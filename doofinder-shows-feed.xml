      <description>This artwork is part of The Out of Africa Collection by the Invictus NFT Lab. These NFTs act as a certificate of ownership that allows the holder to have the physical artwork delivered to them, if they wish. Collectors will bid on NFT representations of the original, physical artworks. The NFT representations will often incorporate animation, or other augmented reality features made possible by digitization. The collection is made up of 100 curated, unique NFTs by top Southern African artists backed by (and redeemable for) physical artworks across a range of mediums. The project is a first foray into the NFT space for most of the participating artists and will introduce their work to a global crypto market.</description>

      <title>Carol-anne Gainer | Ground</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/carol-anne-gainer-ground</link>
      <description>In 2004 the artist excavated the earth of a suburban neighbourhood in Kwa-Zulu Natal for an installation entitled EmBedded, a symbolic way of inserting herself back into the soil of her hometown. The making of a private space, a bedroom &amp;mdash; our safest and most intimate of spaces &amp;mdash; left uncovered, exposed and revealing yet simultaneously reclaiming a very specific geographical territory. Through embodiment and ritual she inserts herself to the world and more importantly, to nature. To home. Moving forward 16 years: Ground, exhibited at Nel Gallery, Cape Town in 2021. The artist continues to explore the deep connections we have to the earth and those that inhabit it. The connections &amp;ndash; physical, spiritual, emotional, energetic - are invisible, yet profoundly impactful and influential to all beings. These works explore the earth; they depict and evoke the complexity of the ground we walk on. They are visceral, emotional, layered artworks that force the viewer to look closer, to see deeper by lifting the veil. They conceal, while at the same time reveal. What at first glance appears to be the intertwined stems of twisted undergrowth reveal to be a hand, a limb; the gnarled root of a tree (both abstract and real) an exploration into the abstract reality we experience with the ever spreading and deepening fracturing and fragility of our earth. Our ground, that which we stand upon.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/roland-gunst-nkisi-nkondi</link>
      <description>Roland Gunst, a.k.a. John K Cobra, (* 1977) is a self-taught conceptual artist, filmmaker and musician of Belgian-Congolese (D.R.C.) descent, living and working between Belgium and South Africa. His work emerges from an autobiographical perspective, being raised in a bicultural family in Congo and migrating to Belgium around the age of 12. Through performances, film and visual art, he reflects on Afro-European strategies and narratives of liberation to counter strategies of oppression on (body) identity and trauma instilled by brute capitalism and its artificial fragmentation and immobilisation of life. Gunst&amp;rsquo;s strategies are developed around what Prof. Cecil Fromont called &quot;spaces of correlation&quot;: spaces of similarity between European and African cultural traditions developed separately but using similar concepts of liberation and pratiques of critique. Gunst uses the human body and architecture to come to a new type of fluid or trans architecture that functions as a moving site of memory. By creating disruptive hybrid concepts and mediums he defies the boundaries that define identity, culture, human condition and history. He is inspired by African and European art history, anthropology, psychology, philosophy and mythology. He works with symbolic materials that are &quot;spaces of correlation&quot; between Europe and Africa: human hair, copper, rubber and wood. All are symbols of power, used in strategies of colonial rule as well as in anti-colonial and anti-capitalist cultural resistance. KWANGA or &quot;life&quot; in Kikongo (a Congolese language) is the name he gave to the Afro-European rubber that he uses in his work as a medium to materialize this vision of transcultural, gender and national fluidity where he believes sites of negotiation and liberation resides. Gunst is an artist and researcher involved in the Critical Network BEyond PARTicipation, a four-year European research project of 9 performance art festivals aimed at developing a better understanding of the interrelationship between power, politics, place and audience in art practice. Gunst&apos;s research is a collaboration with Esther Severi (*1983), a Belgian dramaturge from Brussels.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/umseme-uyakhuluma-a-celestial-conversation</link>
      <description>This project aims to explore the politics of “a seat at the table” and how capitalism and inequality inform the dynamics and rules of engagement within this institutional paradigm. It takes us on a journey, following a subject through their navigation of their conscious and subconscious life and the fears that exist in both realms. Secondly, the project aims to explore the complexities of indigenous cultures paralled with the modern world; and how this impacts the post-colonial world of the African in the 4 th wave of globalization . Thirdly, the project aims to explore the price of representation and the importance of recognizing Africa’s heterogenous nature in the call for unity through representation. Lastly the project acts an invitation of a new idea of being, beyond the existence of current schools of thought and institutions.</description>

      <description>The artist behind this garment is Cinthia Sifa Mulanga. Born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sifa Mulanga’s work explores beauty constructs through her lived experience as an African woman. Using mixed media, she creates moments and conversations within domestic spaces, which function to challenge stereotypes and interrogate misconceptions. This scarf is an artwork – it will look just as good wrapped around your neck as it will framed on your wall.</description>

      <description>Hardground etching is a way of making fine line work. The best ground for line work is beeswax mixed with asphaltum and gum rosin. The plate can be handled without the ground being accidentally nicked. The plate is degreased, set on a heated surface and the ground, which comes in a ball, is spread onto it and then spread out evenly with a rubber brayer. When the wax cools, the plate is smoked with the flame of tapers. Thereafter, lines can be drawn through the ground with any pointed tool &amp;ndash; the traditional one is a pointed metal cylinder called a needle. The resulting print is called a hardground etching. In using hardground, the artist can draw smoothly &amp;ndash; all he or she needs to do is break the wax. The acid does the rest. The longer the plate is in the acid the deeper the bite and the stronger the lines will print. Aquatint is a way of making tones. Despite the &amp;ldquo;aqua&amp;rdquo; in its title, the aquatint process does not involve water. It was invented in the mid-eighteenth century to simulate watercolour drawings. With aquatint one can capture a complete tonal range from a hint of a tone to mid-tones to shadows and darks. Aquatints can be airy like those in the etchings of Paula Rego to velvety like those in the etchings of Pablo Picasso. Aquatint is made by a dense collection of tiny grains melted onto the plate and functions as a porous ground; each grain or clump of grains becomes an island that protects the plate, which the acid will bite around. The most common means of applying the grains is with an aquatint box, made for creating and containing a rosin dust storm. After the dust storm is created, the plate is slipped into the box to collect the grains as they fall. Then it&amp;rsquo;s taken out and heated to melt the grains for them to adhere to the plate once cooled.</description>

      <description>Bonita Alice mainly works in the three-dimensional. Often constructing but at time also making use of the found object, as is the case with this work. It was a gift to her from a friend who bought it from the sale of the state opera fittings when they disbanded in 2003. Filled with ash in its hemn it makes for some dramatic display, weighted by all the ash.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I began solo traveling in 2015. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered all 36 states in Nigeria, I have been to all the regions in the country. However, I am always in awe whenever I travel to the northern part of Nigeria - while Nigerians are quite colourful, there is an unmatched vibrancy that exists in the north. In June 2019, while in Zaria for an assignment and subsequently a vacation, I seized the opportunity to capture the beauty, joy and colours that come with the Sallah celebration.&amp;rdquo; To celebrate Black History Month, Colours of the North was used as a resource to teach photography to a group of young adults in the UK in 2020. The workshop was organised by Hundred Heroines.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/nel-gallery-the-mirror-in-you-and-me</link>
      <description>This group exhibition is grounded by a shared fascination with artist couples––couples who happen to be artists, or artists in relationship. Couples who find themselves in relationship because of a shared passion for art, couples who encourage and inspire each other to make, couples whose respective practices are marked by a sense of collaboration, consciously or unconsciously. Some couples have chosen to exhibit work they’ve made together. Others have decided to show one work each, side by side. Some works demonstrate shared sensibilities in aesthetic or theme, while others are very different stylistically. With this in mind, our investigation has deepened into asking how love might exist as a corporeal presence among artists who create jointly. This could be labeled as the beast—a creature untameable but necessary in a shared journey of discovery. This is what led us to name this exhibition, A Beast with Two Backs, leaning upon what Gillian Rose would call “the work,” the spectral third person that manifests in any relationship—that ghostly presence that is neither entirely you nor me but us – and how that may be represented in art.

      <description>This artist paints people, the people whose faces he remembers, people in everyday life, faces of Jazz singers he listens to, images he saw in old family albums, faces that are conjured in his imagination. Luxolo Witvoet paints the ordinary people that fill his world. He places his &apos;Everyman&apos; on covers of the iconic Drum magazine. This publication leaves an indelible mark on the consciousness of the township community that Luxolo Witvoet himself is a part of. By placing his people in this way he elevates them to the level of celebrity. His stated respect for the work done by the magazine shows that by doing this intervention he holds these ordinary, everyday, working people in high regard. By placing his people on covers of Drum, which he has prepared, he elevates them to the level of celebrity. His stated respect for the work done by the magazine shows that by doing this intervention he holds these ordinary, everyday, working people in high regard. This body of work is a celebration of the ordinary people like mothers, children, initiates, musicians, schoolgirls, old people, youngsters, fathers, and folk who go about their business in unassuming ways. Luxolo Witvoet makes them the true stars that form real society.</description>

      <description>God&amp;rsquo;s Away on Business brings together two new bodies of work that are strikingly different in content and execution, but come from the same critical view of global current affairs. Borrowing the title of the exhibition from a Tom Waits song, Penn invokes Waits&amp;rsquo;s leaden pessimism (&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all over, it&amp;rsquo;s all over, it&amp;rsquo;s all over&amp;rdquo;), but reminds us that in the midst of crisis and collapse, there can be lightness, humour, and sublime beauty.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/nel-gallery-the-truth-about-love</link>
      <description>As Black creatives are often called upon to address more prevalent matters, such as the socio-economic and cultural impacts of racism, the topic of love is perceived as a soft issue and therefor not significant enough to discuss. &amp;lsquo;The Truth about love&amp;rsquo; explores aspects of love, ranging from self-love and to spiritual love, to family love, to romantic love, and calls attention to the importance of love as an aspect of decoloniality. Inspired by the works of social commentator Bell Hooks, this body of work refutes the view that the topic of love should take a back seat to the more overwhelming issues faced by communities of colour, and explores the ethics of love being the basis of freedom. Poem | All About Love (as per Bell Hooks) Let us not engage in heartbreak. No, Not at all, I do not dislike you, what has Given you this ugly idea. I simply don&amp;rsquo;t trust you Very much. Not much too much. You are Incredibly charming but a woman needs to feel Safe, even while she wants to feel wanted. Get What I mean? (She slinkers over to the side of The room he is standing on, touches his cheek With a graze.) Makes love uncomfortable don&amp;rsquo;t it honey, but not Impossible. Not impossible. (She exhales her Cigarette.) Love is never impossible. Only ill-advised, Most Times, surely. Love is often a bad idea, still who doesn&amp;rsquo;t take it. What kind of a god does not take love? Here I stand. I have been very lonely and very beautiful for very Long. Today my feet ache. The meal on the table is Warmed. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s lamb curry. A candle because The electricity is out again. Come, take a seat, (she Rubs his shoulders), let us eat.</description>

      <description>How could a thought be an object that made itself? Could the air inside a balloon be the answer as to not only what, but also how? Artist Stevan Sack utilises his interest in play, music, and time to navigate through the constraints of the working artist, and find ways for art to create itself. In reflection, Sack remarks that &amp;ldquo;I was only capable of short spurts at focusing, condensing, and the beginning of rather rambling thinking. A thought containing an idea, or a possible action would emerge, and be forgotten.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Ashima&amp;rsquo; examines the dichotomy of African identity. Someone who acknowledges that time-honoured traditions, history and ritual are worthy of preservation, yet progress and the challenging of norms is inevitable and indeed deeply uncomfortable. The Harmattan wind is a weighty time in many a Nigerian life &amp;ndash; it signifies the start of the holiday season and family gatherings. It also brings with it dust from the Sahara and common ailments like asthma (Ashima), an affliction artist Muoh has suffered since childhood. Come the end of November, the dry, dusty and windy Harmattan season descends on Nigeria and the rest of West Africa, and with it, a slew of customs that are ingrained in many Nigerians&amp;rsquo; lives. However, as climate change, urbanisation and a move away from tradition continue, many Gen Z and Millennial Nigerians no longer participate in these time-honoured rituals. Muoh has a reputation for delving deep into the issues that many women of her generation face. She examines the phenomenon of loss of culture as it sits alongside deep-set societal conditioning and the discomfort that straddling two worlds brings. As a result, her work emits a distinct tension as she faces up to, and casts open, conversations that may be difficult to have. The advent of the Harmattan season and its associated customs have been part of many Nigerians&amp;rsquo; lives for generations. The cooler (and windy) season arrives in November, a time when Westernoriented knitted jerseys become social talking points since the Harmattan season is a rare opportunity to show off these fetching garments. Dry, chapped lips and skin, as well as asthma, are daily irritants, and the everpresent layer of dust in the home, is a constant annoyance. But with global warming and the shift in the dusty wind&amp;rsquo;s arrivals, along with the younger generations snubbing many traditions like church and Christmas clothes, Muoh brings to light some important conversations around shifting cultural and climatic norms. &amp;ldquo;Sometimes I feel like I am alone in these feelings and I want to start a conversation around them &amp;ndash; for me, my art is a powerful way to find a common and relatable ground&amp;rdquo;, she says. She delves into her subject matter with a deep appreciation for symbols, and a marriage of surreal imagery applied to the everyday modern urban scenes she is surrounded by. A trained graphic designer, she loves colour, and this shows in her bold and richly hued artworks &amp;ndash; the kinds of pieces that command conversation, but which are also supremely approachable. Muoh is also deeply absorbed in the shifting sands of Nigerian patriarchal society and this body, like her others, continues with the use of surrealist motifs to reflect this.

      <description>Olatoye is an outspoken and loyal advocate towards the feminist movement, and regularly comments on the power and potential of women in an otherwise patriarchal society. Raised by an independent single mother, his perspective as the oldest child plays a crucial role in this portrait, edifying a woman of substance, serenity and supreme nurturing. A woman who is a powerful figure at home but continues to play a critical role as a leader and force to reckon with, without losing her poise amidst the challenges of life.</description>

      <description>oge adighi eche mmadu | Time Waits For No One REWA reflects on the passing of time for young and single Igbo women, as with each new year that passes, the expectation of becoming an honourable woman in society, i.e. married with children becomes ever more urgent. Whilst a birthday is a celebratory occasion, it is also a reminder of the ticking of the &apos;biological clock&apos;, and can therefore be equally daunting. REWA is a figurative abstract artist of Igbo-Nigerian heritage based in Lagos, Nigeria. Raised between Nigeria and England, her hybrid upbringing greatly informs her practice which she coined, Igbo vernacular art; a contemporary outlook on the lifestyles and values of the 21st century Igbo woman, navigating ancient traditions and new social norms and expectations. In her own words: &amp;lsquo;My art is drawn from life itself and deeply anchored in a place and culture from which it was derived and so I believe that this description is more accurate as it implies a unique iteration of customs and tradition, bound to a particular location and a particular people&amp;rsquo;. Whilst her work is rooted in a specific tradition, location and custom, REWA&amp;rsquo;s portraits explore many universal themes, such as the notion of marriage, motherhood, societal roles and expectations that modern women today navigate and strive to reconcile in a world that is still upheld by patriarchy.</description>

      <description>Signed by artist. The commodification and appropriation of cultural emblems and art is an important theme in much of Dj&amp;eacute;ka&amp;rsquo;s work and his use of the &amp;lsquo;001&amp;rsquo; tag is a clear indicator of this. Like &amp;lsquo;Abo Hinsan&amp;rsquo; this work shows the woman as a warrior and protector.</description>

      <description>Ivorian visual artist and painter Claudie Titty Dimbeng is based in Paris and through her dynamic series of paintings called: &apos;The Gynaeceum&apos; the artist intimately explores women&apos;s sexuality and its true expression, as experienced by women without shame or reprisal. Dimbeng&apos;s Techinique &amp; Approach to Painting &apos;Mixed Art Relief&apos; is my mixed media painting technique which consists in producing an abstract or figurative work, where materials, forms and colors merge, thanks to the sanding and the sfumato , contributing to the highlighting of my themes: gynaeceum , African spirituality, and contemporary issues . Inspired by Vohou-vohou , it employs materials, such as raffia or tapa , which bring more texture to the color, and the subject gradually reveals itself. When the canvas is &quot;sculpted&quot;, all facets of life spring through symbols. In my case, it will be about procreation, animal, vegetable or human forms. Thanks to the materials used, the Mixed Art Relief links the original culture of the artist to that of his adopted and crossing territories, and promotes intercultural dialogue, which creates value. At a time when the question of identity and otherness can raise questions, even unleash passions, &amp;ldquo;Dialogue therefore consists in allowing people to accept difference &amp;rdquo;. My interest today is particularly focused on the forms of iteration and self-similarities at different scales, produced by this technique. My research on this phenomenon led me to the mathematician Beno&amp;icirc;t Mandelbrot, father of fractals , and to the Fractalist movement that question me. How do we evolve in this geometry of nature ? Through what type of social and cultural interactions? What impact do we have on our universe governed by the roughness of forms, outside the framework of the smooth and ordered space of Euclidean geometry? How are we fractal beings?&apos; - CLAUDIE TITTY DIMBENG</description>

      <description>Olatoye is an outspoken and loyal advocate towards the feminist movement, and regularly comments on the power and potential of women in an otherwise patriarchal society. Raised by an independent single mother, his perspective as the oldest child plays a crucial role in this portrait, edifying a woman of substance, serenity and supreme nurturing. A woman who is a powerful figure at home but continues to play a critical role as a leader and force to reckon with, without losing her poise amidst the challenges of life.</description>

      <title>Origin Art |Tracks and Traces: Abstraction in Painting and Photography</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/origin-art-tracks-and-traces-abstraction-in-painting-and-photography</link>
      <description>#html-body [data-pb-style=DKE8MIE]{justify-content:flex-start;display:flex;flex-direction:column;background-position:left top;background-size:cover;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-attachment:scroll} More about the body of work included in the exhibition: Inhabiting a studio situated at the heart of the urban landscape of Johannesburg, South Africa, I frequently feel bombarded by an overflow of information. The weight of global concerns intertwined with our local narrative compounds this inundation. The demand to engage meaningfully can often leave me feeling overstimulated and depleted. In an effort to manage the vast influx of information, I retreat—sometimes mentally, sometimes physically—escaping the city&apos;s clamour to immerse myself in the unlimited expanse of nature. However, this immersion in nature reveals an unexpected truth: nature’s tranquillity is not an inherent certainty. These expansive landscapes, in themselves, can trigger conflicting sensations. Within this panorama, visual points of attention within the landscape act as anchors, punctuating contemplative moments. They symbolize introspection and the strength needed to navigate life&apos;s intricacies. In my studio, I capture fleeting glimmers, transforming them into windows of self-reflection. This journey through the landscape mirrors my interaction with reality, reminding me that equilibrium is vital in our complex society. As these methods permeate my artistic approach, they gradually integrate into my engagement with society. This series represents an exploration of introspection, an abstraction of my subjectmatter, in order to clarify a sense of stillness amidst the chaos. As Johannesburg&apos;s bustle and the global turmoil persist, my work echoes the transformative power of locating calm within upheaval. It serves as a tribute to balance, a visual testament to discovering serenity, ultimately finding harmony with the tumultuous nature of life.</description>

      <description>Hand-signed by the artist - bottom right. Broda James (Broda is a common term of respect for an elder) is the ubiquitous shopkeeper known to Africans all over the continent. Here, he is seated at the counter of his store, stocked with Heinz Baked Beans and a common pantry staple Dano Milk Powder, both expensive imports from Europe. Of importance in this image is the presence of an electronic pay point &amp;ndash; a commentary on the chaotic state of the Nigerian economy, where the poor are driven into further poverty as the government makes inconsistent decisions around tender and cashless transactions without thinking about the consequences for its citizens.

      <description>NOTE: I&apos;m a sole practitioner and, hence, not a VAT-registered vendor. Thus the listed price is the full cost (Plus shipping costs). Negotiation [portait] (2010; first printing 2023) Detailed specs: Two photographs printed with Epson Ultrachrome pigment inks on Felix Schoeller True Fibre Matt, 200gsm, photo matt paper. Each photo: Paper size: 26.5 x 35.8 cm; Image size: 25.3 x 34 cm. Edition of 7 + 2 AP. Diptych ( to be mounted in a single frame ); each photograph signed and numbered on verso. ( See 4th image above to get a sense of the work framed ). BACKGROUND: Negotiation , the original work, realised in 2010, consisted of a time-based site-specific intervention. The intervention made use of equal volumes of repositioned soil and lawn from the main courtyard of the Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG) and Joubert Park respectively. The original work is evidenced, here (2023) in an editioned photographic diptych, shown for the first time at &amp;lsquo;Sunny Side Up&amp;rsquo;, the summer group show that opened at Graham Contemporary Gallery on Thursday 26th January 2023. Below follows an edited and extended version of the text released on the occasion of the intervention at the JAG, in 2010: The site-specific intervention Negotiation (2010) forms part of a large and ongoing body of work (1) that considers underlying power relationships implicit in spatial configurations in various institutional and urban contexts. In my artistic practice, Negotiation and other site-specific works have developed from moving away from my original position of &amp;lsquo;making&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;doing&amp;rsquo;, architecture, towards its &amp;lsquo;unmaking&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;undoing&amp;rsquo;. Through an interrogative process I aim, in my works and my writings, for a re-versing and extension of the staid and self-assured discipline of architecture. Negotiation addressed the strangely dysfunctional relationship between the institution of the museum and the institution of the park. It considers the space of the park, adjacent to the museum, as a different and more dynamic form of what we conventionally understand the &amp;lsquo;archive&amp;rsquo; to be. It imagines the park as a produced and lived archive, a counter to the calculated accumulation constituting the mausoleum-like, inanimate archive of the JAG&amp;rsquo;s vast collection of artworks. For this site-specific intervention, parts of the park and museum surface were physically cut, lifted and moved. These park and museum excisions were then reciprocally re-placed and dis-placed into the temporarily voided surfaces of their adjacent typology, respectively: a precise square meterage of the park&amp;rsquo;s lawn was cut-and-pasted into the museum&amp;rsquo;s central courtyard; the same square meterage of the museum courtyard was cut out and transplanted into the park. This archaeological swap opened, and continues to open up, questions about the passed-down definitions, meanings and values of prescriptive and predominantly western typologies &amp;ndash; such as &amp;lsquo;museum&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;park&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; in the context of Johannesburg. The transplanting of one &amp;lsquo;accepted&amp;rsquo; spatial construct into another results not only in a reversal, but also a typological doubling and re-naming of the two public &amp;lsquo;bodies&amp;rsquo; under consideration: the park &amp;lsquo;becomes&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; at least momentarily &amp;ndash; the museum, and the museum the park. The intervention involved the literal cutting of the word &apos;museum&apos; out of the grassy surface of the park, in a gridded, pixel-like font. Similarly the word &apos;park&apos; was sliced out of the museum&amp;rsquo;s central courtyard in square-shaped segments. Each cutting manoeuvre resulted in transplantable blocks of exactly the same lifted quantities of grass (park lawn) and soil (museum courtyard). Once extracted these blocks were then re-cast into their new positions: the soil from the museum courtyard was transferred to the park and was used to spell out the word &apos;museum&apos;; the excavated segments of park lawn were used to fill up the void that had resulted from cutting out the word &apos;park&apos; in the museum&amp;rsquo;s courtyard. I predicted that, over the course of the &amp;lsquo;Time&amp;rsquo;s Arrow&amp;rsquo; exhibition, the soil transferred from the museum courtyard into the park would become over-grown by the park lawn &amp;ndash; in other words, that the transferred piece of the museum would be absorbed and essentially &amp;lsquo;overwritten&amp;rsquo; by the park. Similarly, I envisioned that the imported lawn spelling the word &apos;park&apos; in the museum courtyard would likely be refused by its new host, in the context of the museum&amp;rsquo;s mostly shaded courtyard. For this exercise, the shifted and grafted park and museum matter became &amp;ndash; to borrow a term from Robert Smithson &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;non-sites&amp;rsquo; (2) removed, reconfigured, re-membered and ultimately rejected by their new contexts. The entropic displacement of the matter comprising the respective &amp;lsquo;type-cast&amp;rsquo; surfaces resulted in a simultaneous yet precarious balance of difference and sameness. The uncanny condition of tension the intervention managed to set up was heightened by the presence of the contested palisade fence, which acted &amp;ndash; and still acts &amp;ndash; as an awkward hindrance between &amp;lsquo;park&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;museum&amp;rsquo;. The way these two public spaces tended to, and continue to, marginalise each other and their respective user groups was temporarily undermined by the guerrilla-like nature of this exercise of dual ex-scription, resulting in the forced slippage of the two surfaces into one . The displacement of the park and museum respectively was carried out to prompt hopeful reimaginings. The intervention used notions of mirroring, doubling, mimicking, rescripting and re-inscription to prompt new possibilities of value exchange and hybridisation. It flagged the need for radical thought around the realisation of constructive institutional redefinition, dismantling &amp;ndash; even possible dissolution &amp;ndash; towards new, coproduced and anti-typological fora of public and cultural exchange. In conclusion, the above process of the &amp;lsquo;undoing&amp;rsquo; of physical fabric was an attempt to understand but, more importantly, to interrogate and undermine what is already there, and highlight the stasis that exists as a result of a lack of fluid and dynamic exchange between what are, in fact, two potentially excellent public (both can be visited freely and are free of charge) resources. The time-based (un)becoming of these two complex publics provoked the question of why and how we measure and ascribe value to these spaces in their current forms: the crypt-like, fortified museum and its largely hidden archive, and the visible and unpredictable lived &amp;lsquo;archive&amp;rsquo; of the park. The intervention&amp;rsquo;s deforming and transforming moves attempted to raise issues and encourage critical debate around the generally unquestioned conventions that govern a hierarchical disposition of spaces within buildings and cities, the power relationships that exist between architectural and urban spaces, and the absolutist morphologies of architecture at large. (1) Negotiation develops certain of Robert Smithson&amp;rsquo;s notions, especially regarding his indoor works constituting matter from outdoor sites, into a potentially endlessly recurring entropic transferral of an outside into an inside (park-museum-park&amp;hellip; ad infinitum). (2) For details of site-specific works leading up to the making of Negotiation , see the paper Undoing Architecture (presented by the artist at the On Making colloquium, at the University of Johannesburg&amp;rsquo;s Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture, in October of 2009): https://www.academia.edu/21407615/_Undoing_Architecture_2010_double_blind_peer_reviewed_paper_published_in_conference_proceedings_book_</description>

      <title>Madlozi Contemporary Art Gallery | Jambanja, Urban Chaos Interrupted</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/madlozi-contemporary-art-gallery-jambanja-urban-chaos-interrupted</link>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;Undocumented Life of A Migrant&amp;rsquo; 2023 is a work in which the artist examines the urgency around being a documented citizen in order to escape the permenent distress that being a &apos;stateless&apos; immigrant creates. Passports, visas, permits and the importance of refugee status - artist George Masarira revelas how the papers required to cross borders and enable a fresh start are hard to come by, and the barrier between acceptance and alienation for those who cross borders annually in Africa and worldwide. The painting is featured in the artist&apos;s new solo exhibition &apos;Jambanja, Urban Chaos Interrupted&apos; with Madlozi Contemporary Art.</description>

      <description>Amy Leigh Braaf is a South African artist, who intricately explores self-discovery and complexities of love through her art, drawing from the nation&apos;s biodiversity. Her pieces symbolize the navigation of her identity as a woman of mixed Cape Malay and Indonesian heritage. Braaf&amp;rsquo;s journey encapsulates cultural heritage, self-discovery, and timeless connections, resonating as an ode to human existence, weaving stories of generations past and present into an evocative dance of life.</description>

      <description>MORWALO, art is made of the same material as the social exchanges, it has a special place in the collective production process, a gathering. A Stroll demonstrates not only its manufacturing and production process, its position within the set of exchanges, and the place, or function, it allocates to the beholder, but also the creative behaviour of the artist, otherwise put, the sequence of postures and gestures which make up Oupa Sibeko&apos;s work, and which each work passes on like a marker. MORWALO, takes shape across disciplines, and it manifests in the form of paintings, drawings, installations, performative gestures and film; all employed as tools for building narratives about space, vulnerability, movement and play about the public space. Oupa Sibeko recent work continues to be invested in materiality, often combining unconventional tools such as mosquito net and bubble wrap to further explore a continuous motion of playing with the self and others to build a shared experience.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ephemera Memetic is a meditation on entropy, prompted by the death of my father and the experience of grief and its transference across the broader human project. It is an investigation of history; it&apos;s patterns, ghosts, imprinted memories and enduring structures. It is a mourning for a dying planet as well as a restored hope, partly in vain, for a stronger, more loving world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maine&apos;s artistic journey has long focused on portraying imagined individuals of black and brown descent in vibrant acrylic paintings and ink drawings. His recent body of work, however, Maine examines the symbolism of the black plastic chair. This ordinary yet ubiquitous object serves as a central motif in his exploration of themes such as healing, isolation, community, and personal transformation within the context of recovery. Through his acrylic paintings on canvas, Maine scrutinizes and reinterprets the significance of the chair, offering viewers a nuanced perspective on its cultural and emotional resonance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Expressionism#NeoExpressionism#Still life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RESERVOIR | Reimagining Themba</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/reservoir-reimagining-themba</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This image forms part of the body of work, &quot;Reimagining Themba&quot; - a project in celebration of resilience and human spirit, created in collaboration with Little Lions Child Coaching (Cape Town). At the heart of Little Lions lies a steadfast commitment to go beyond statistics, to delve into the depths of human experience, and to amplify the voices of those whose stories are often overlooked. &quot;Reimagining Themba&quot; stands as a testament to this commitment, an embodiment of our unwavering dedication to spark meaningful conversations and cultivate a culture of empathy and understanding. Inspired by the indomitable spirit of Themba a symbol of hope and curiosity we embarked on a transformative journey, guided by the visionary artistry of Mikhailia Petersen. In collaboration with twelve young mentees from the Little Lions programme, Petersen crafted a series of photographs that transcend the boundaries of mere imagery; weaving together narratives of resilience, courage, and joy. For Petersen, this project is not merely a creative endeavour; it is a deeply personal odyssey of healing and rediscovery. Having grown up in the shadow of mental illness, she intimately understands the stigma and shame that often accompany discussions surrounding mental health. Yet, through her lens, she reframes the narrative, celebrating the inherent strength and beauty of every individual. &quot;Together, we ventured into a world of boundless imagination and uninhibited expression, where each frame serves as a testament to the unique qualities that define us &amp;ndash; courage, kindness, intelligence, and humour. Through this collaborative effort, we strive not only to initiate dialogues but also to cultivate a sense of belonging and acceptance within our community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;⁠&amp;nbsp; ⁠Mikhailia Petersen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;25% of the profits of each artwork sold will go to support the Little Lions programme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simone Verfaille | Thought Patterns</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/simone-verfaille-thought-patterns</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This piece is part of a larger body of work titled, Thought Patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THOUGHT PATTERNS&lt;/em&gt; delves into my internal dialogue about productivity, growth, stagnation. The cycles of thought that shape my creative process expressed in this body of work. A sense of simplicity is created by stripping away the distractions of colour to focus on form, line, and composition. I&apos;ve found that patterns emerge, intertwining to form a tapestry of connected thinking. The artworks reflect my exploration and witnessing of the evolving nature of recurring thoughts, the tension between movement and stillness, and how moments of meditative flow can paradoxically fuel true progress and expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christopher Moller Gallery | Rwendo Rwechokwadi - a journey of truth</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/christopher-moller-gallery-rwendo-rwechokwadi-a-journey-of-truth</link>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;A Broken Nation&amp;rsquo; is a powerful reflection by Mbayiwa on the current state of Zimbabwe, where nearly every sector appears to be in decline. The artwork speaks to the frustration and despair felt by many, particularly the youth, who emerge from an education system that continues to produce graduates with little promise of employment . Meanwhile, the health sector lies in disrepair&amp;mdash; hospitals lack basic equipment and medicine, leading to preventable suffering and loss of life. Central to the work is the concept of septa&amp;mdash; wisdom traditionally passed from one generation to the next. In a culture that deeply values heritage and continuity, septa represent guidance, stability, and a sense of purpose. Yet in a society where leadership prioritises self-preservation over public service, this ancestral wisdom loses its weight. It becomes an echo of what should be, rather than a living practice. The metaphor of leaders &amp;ldquo;putting their heads in the sand&amp;rdquo; underscores the wilful denial of the country&amp;rsquo;s challenges. By refusing to acknowledge the reality on the ground, those in power effectively abandon their duty to protect and uplift their people. The result is a fractured nation, where hope is dim and daily life is marked by hardship. Through this piece, Mbayiwa calls for accountability and urgent transformation. His work is both a critique and a rallying cry&amp;mdash;a demand for a better Zimbabwe, shaped by truth, responsibility, and a collective will to rebuild what has been broken.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/nel-revisiting-museutopia</link>
      <description>This triptych is composed of two parts. On the sides is a photo I took at The National Museum of Ethnography and Natural History in Chisinau (2009), and in the middle is a photograph I took at the History of the IDF Museum, which was dismantled in 2019. It was the largest military museum in Israel, established on an army base in Tel Aviv in 1988. Initially, it exhibited a trophy weapons collection right after the end of the First Israel-Lebanon War and later expanded to house an immense weapons collection of more than 4,000 items. The National Museum of Ethnography and Natural History is historically the oldest and most significant scientific museum in Moldova, opened in 1904. Over the years, it went through many phases, and after the fall of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the independent Republic of Moldova, a new vision of Moldovan history had to be presented to the public. It took about four years to develop the permanent exhibition, which was created following a UNESCO manual. The museum presents the creation of the universe from the Moldovan perspective, both scientifically and theologically. The hall in the photograph depicts the four corners of the Moldovan landscape. What you see is a realistic painting on the wall of the Prut River delta and its typical exotic wildlife, with a three-dimensional topographical scale model in the center. What is important to note&amp;mdash;and what adds a twist to its meaning&amp;mdash;is that Transnistria is located exactly there. This was the first instance, in 1990, when Russia created a disruption in Moldova, establishing the first independent republic supported by Russia but unrecognized by any other country in the world. The same geopolitical dynamics occurred between Russia and Ukraine in 2014. What was striking about the IDF Museum in Tel Aviv was that, despite being the largest of its time, it was not designed by professional exhibition designers and lacked a clear vision of its mission statement and visual language. It was divided into 16 thematic pavilions, roughly corresponding to the various branches of the land forces (The Air Force and the Navy have their own separate museums elsewhere). A large section was dedicated to trophy weapons taken from Arab armies, along with a pavilion specifically for weapons captured from Palestinian organizations. The mannequin wearing the camouflage uniform was displayed in the Israeli chain of supply pavilion at the former IDF Museum. The essence of the triptych lies in the visual connection between the soldier&apos;s uniform, the topographical model, and the poignant landscape painted on the wall.</description>

      <description>Full title: What sense it makes for these two mornings to exist side by side in the world where we live, should this be framed as a question, would not be answerable by philosophy or poetry or finance or by the shallows or the deeps of her own mind, she fears (second morning)</description>

      <description>I visited and interviewed two individuals who had both encountered and interacted with beings associated with the local Western Cape mermaid mythology&amp;mdash;figures also depicted in San rock art. Their personal accounts were vivid and compelling, each describing a profound, extraordinary, and liminal experience. Deeply inspired by their recollections of that significant day, I created this painting from my imagination, interpreting what I believed they had witnessed.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/pages/shows/nel-when-i-arrived-you-d-already-left</link>
      <description>This series unfolds from a kind of constructed longing &amp;mdash; a fantasy tethered to the real, but always at a remove. It begins not with my own steps through a landscape, but with images: documentation of hikes undertaken by strangers, uploaded, tagged, filtered, shared. These glimpses &amp;mdash; scenic outlooks, blurred motion, ecstatic summits &amp;mdash; summon a yearning for immersion in something beyond the urban churn. A nostalgia not for a specific place, but for an experience never had. The works are thrice removed. Once: I was never there. Twice: the event is mediated through another&amp;rsquo;s lens &amp;mdash; their framing, their gesture. Thrice: the drawing, my drawing, reinterprets that image, translating it through the slow labour of mark-making. What emerges is not a record of presence, but a residue of absence. The hike is not depicted &amp;mdash; it is inferred , imagined, abstracted. This is not a series about hiking. It is about the distance between experience and representation. About how we borrow the lives of others in search of meaning. About the quiet melancholy that settles when we realise the sublime has become scrollable &amp;mdash; consumed, flattened, dislocated. These drawings are artefacts of that dislocation, shaped by longing and lack. They are neither maps nor memories, but something else entirely: a trace of a desire to be elsewhere.</description>
