      <title>RESERVOIR presents a new a solo exhibition by Bella Knemeyer</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/interviews/reservoir-presents-a-new-a-solo-exhibition-by-bella-knemeyer-3</link>
      <description>RESERVOIR presents a new a solo exhibition by Bella Knemeyer Bella Knemeyer in studio, photography credit: Jonathan Kope -------------- RESERVOIR presents Here, there and everywhere, a solo exhibition by South African artist Bella Knemeyer. The opening event took place on Thursday, 13 February 2025, and the exhibition runs until 28 March 2025. Enclosed is an excerpt of the exhibition text, The promise of repair by Hedley Twidle. At some point in the last ten years, human-made things – infrastructure, concrete, metals, asphalts, aggregates, plastics and all the rest – began to exceed the combined weight of all biomass on earth. Exactly where you place the crossover point depends: are we counting only things constructed (bridges, roads, buildings)? Or also the waste left behind after their making: mine dumps, tailings, landfill, scrapyards, piles of rubble? In 1900 (scientists estimate) human-made stuff clocked in at 3% of organic matter (everything from trees to tundra, cattle to plankton). Today human civilization weighs in at 1,1 trillion metric tonnes (the more conservative estimate). A million million tonnes, that is, pressing down on the earth’s crust, present and future. Bella Knemeyer, Pine (detail), 2025, Mulched paper with acrylic on canvas, 159.5 x 106cm, price on request, ENQUIRE In Bella Knemeyer’s work, panels of mulched paper are scored with fine striations or imbued with a delicate mesh. On shelves in her studio are pebbles of granite, dirty whitish and speckled with black grains. Or at least this is what I took them for, until I pick one up and find it unaccountably light. Also formed of papier-mâché, mixed with slate chips picked up from the railway that runs to Simonstown (where her studio is located, looking over the station, the naval dockyards and the glittering metal sheet of False Bay beyond). There are also delicate arrangements of wire with fulcrums, counterweights, like scales or seesaws; and cylinders (also paper) hanging down like those from an old pendulum clock. The combined mass of this entire body of work, I imagine, would be negligible. Even when including the small grey panels pitted with imperfections and scored with wire: portable diptychs and triptychs of concrete that remind you just how beautiful this material can be. Bella Knemeyer solo exhibition, Installation shot, courtesy of RESERVOIR ‘Materials change shape as they travel from geological deposit or forest or factory and design project to landfill’ – so writes Jane Hutton in Reciprocal Landscapes, her attempt to move back and forth between distant production site and designed landscape, to trace itineraries of the things that make up our profoundly altered world: ‘Where did they come from? What are the social and ecological conditions of their manufacture? Who made them? What is left in their place?’ The exponential growth of the built environment across the 20th and 21st centuries – an irruption of technosphere into biosphere – has happened largely within living memory (particularly following the so-called Great Acceleration post-second world war, with its large-scale adoption of concrete, crude oil derivatives and asphalt). We live within its consequences at every turn; yet somehow it is hard to believe, to imagine or take as entirely real. Bella Knemeyer, This world should be more wonderful, 2025, Mulched paper with acrylic on canvas, 130 x 100cm, price on request, ENQUIRE The unthinkable weight of this world historical process – its complex and unceasing flows of extraction, fabrication, deconstruction, beneficiation, displacement, dumping and disposal – haunts Knemeyer’s work, but in a subtle, sublimated way. The quiet delicacy of her panels and maquettes exist in an inverse or indexical relation to the flows they point to: the frenzied demolition and construction in capitalist core nations or growing urban hubs.

      <title>FEATURE: On K Sello Duiker, Damien Hirst, and Mountain Retreats</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/exhibitors/feature-on-k-sello-duiker-damien-hirst-and-mountain-retreats</link>
      <description>FEATURE: On K Sello Duiker, Damien Hirst, and Mountain Retreats A feature by Ashraf Jamal for ArtThrob My dog and I are in ‘K Sello’ (Duiker), my daughter next door in ‘Herman’ (Charles Bosman). We’re at McBains in Bainskloof, a mountain retreat co-owned by Justin Nurse and Ma’ayan Hamiltion. He — K Sello — is a long-lost, long-dead friend and author of the most significant South African novel of the last 30 years, The Quiet Violence of Dreams. Pre-woke, Duiker’s novel has an honesty few comprehend today. He saw the rise of ‘neo-black’ fascism and wrote the dirt on our pathological inheritance in a prose that is alive to a human perversity which most these days suppress, or worse, ‘cancel’. Revisionism is the new norm; the art world aglow with nuclear green sanctimony. Not something that Duiker would have approved of, well, not the desperate-contrite-faux sheen of care which generally accompanies the heist at least. Then again, revisionism has greater merit than Damien Hirst’s toxic ‘Empathy Suite’ in the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. At $100,000 a night, it is the most expensive on earth, replete with two bull sharks in formaldehyde titled Winner/Loser and a bar—Here For A Good Time Not a Long Time—that’s packed with medical waste. Pumped with all the cynicism one associates with a Martin Amis novel, Hirst’s ‘Empathy Suite’ is a sick thought designed to shock and boggle the heart. In Las Vegas, nothing in fact stays; everything is news. Damien Hirst’s Empathy Suite at Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas. Around a fire I relate the story of Hirst’s suite to Nurse. It’s my first getaway in six months. We were all held hostage, victims of a ‘class suicide’ and successful plot to bankrupt not only a national economy but human feeling, family, the need for hugs. In short, empathy. That Hirst should baptise his suite so calculatedly and so wrongly is a bilious reminder of how perverse words have become. Of course, one can ‘laugh it off’, as Nurse has done, but sick wit cannot dispel the fact that ours is a venal and heartless age in which revisionism — throwing good will after bad — is little too late. I think Duiker would agree. I recall the two of us in a bar in Noordhoek a few months before he killed himself. We were at the Miramax Scriptwriting Workshop. Medicated to the gills, he was nevertheless utterly alert and warm. There was a fullness there, despite the shot rigging. He must have known, despite his gentle modesty, that his ballsy, brilliant, overwritten novel would last forever. That his name would be consecrated in a mountain retreat is another matter. Nothing Hirst ever created could warrant such grace, though Nurse informs me that his personal encounter with the insufferable brat was heartening. They’d met in a rehab centre in Cape Town where Hirst’s girlfriend was billeted, and Nurse worked as a councillor. Cape Town is a rehab mecca. I once met a man in a café in Observatory who’d quit New York for Cape Town in a desperate attempt to save his nose, whose function and form had been destroyed by coke. Gentle, elegant, and tragic, he spoke to me of Buddha. Reflecting on this meld of addiction and grace, it seems a fallible compound of a gone era. Today one is exercised by or subject to extremes. Grace is a dead idea. As is empathy. There is no relief from hypocrisy, cruelty, rage. Hirst’s ‘Empathy Suite’ sums up the callowness and callousness of our age. Kemang Wa Lehulere, Once bitten, twice shy [Detail], 2016. Salvaged school desks, dentures, gold-leaf-covered books, steel Nurse tells me that when he is not in Bainskloof he lives in a complex in Muizenberg, which he manages. He is, as they say, a ‘people person’. His neighbour is Kemang wa Lehulere, which intrigues me, given that I’d chatted with Wa Lehulere at Café Ganesh the night before. Despite my disgust in the face of a global inhumanity, I was profoundly moved by the artist’s ability to coax self-belief in a young tech whizz. Wa Lehulere listens, emboldens, restores heart. But as Nurse informs me, he is also a terrible parker, his vehicle out of joint, overstepping the grid, wild in its disregard for propriety and form, which is unsurprising, given his art and vision. I’ll be visiting the artist’s studio when I get back to the city. Now, however, it is Nurse who holds my attention. Nurse has just emerged into the lounge to settle by the fire, having read the book he hands to me, How To Change Your Mind, The New Science of Psychedelics by Michael Pollan who, ‘under the influence of toad venom, becomes convinced he’s giving birth to himself.’ The sentiment is fitting: what else is left to do? Given a global rage that has metastasized, how does one nurture, engender, self-create? If there is precious little room to translate a good feeling — if ours is a time tin-eared, tone deaf, bereft of subtlety — imbibing some toad venom is clearly a good thing. For all my gloom, my rabid despair, I cannot fault the need for decency, kindness, grace. It’s why I’m installed in my personal empathy suite, K Sello, huddled about a fire, mountain water pounding through the gully beneath. Laugh It Off’s infamous Black Labour spoof t-shirt Between 2000 and 2005, Nurse was embroiled in a now legendary legal battle which centred on his spoofing of twenty brands, most notoriously his tagline, ‘BLACK LABOUR WHITE GUILT.’ A riff on SAB’s beer, Black Label, Nurse was charged with ‘hate speech’, of ‘not exercising freedom of expression but abusing it.’ It’s day two of my stay and we are seated on deck overlooking the thudding river, fluffy blankets about our shoulders. ‘Satire is still a form of art I guess,’ Nurse muses, though he remains uncertain. Ours is a humourless time; ‘brand spoofing passe.’ He had ‘more gumption and stomach then.’ We all did. ‘Now there’s no way of saying things without being castrated.’ Still, ‘against cancel culture and trolling we need healthy conversation.’ And if this seems well-nigh impossible, there’s always Nurse’s mountain retreat, where the ‘silence is so loud, the water so cold.’ Nurse has ‘an appetite for life.’ He plans to transform Bainskloof into a ‘lockdown pop-up space for art that inspires change.’ Peter van Straten is a much-loved favourite because of the artist’s humour and the beauty of the execution. As we speak, McBains is undergoing a face-lift, its exterior walls transformed by two street artists, Sven Christian and Martin Lund. Christian is working on a tribute to Paul du Toit who, prior to his death, took his oxygen tank with him on a final getaway to an island in the Indian Ocean. Alongside the painting, Christian has added Du Toit’s words from a scrapbook — ‘No one is going to do it for you.’ The sentiment is bracing, especially now that we are all indentured, co-opted, denied the right to speak our minds. But there, in that mountain retreat in Bainskloof — its access road built by prisoners and engineered by Andrew Geddes Bain (1797–1864) — it seems as if it’s still possible, even if Nurse has doubts as to what can and can’t be spoofed. K Sello Duiker, universally celebrated, and Paul du Toit, still maligned by art snobs, live on. Answering his own question — ‘How important is art in these times?’ — Nurse reminds us that art, and the life we create to make it possible, still ‘inspires change,’ if you have the ‘appetite.’ Here I find myself returning to Nurse’s best-known slogan, ‘BLACK LABOUR WHITE GUILT’. Its currency persists, though who, supposedly, has the right to speak in its name skews the slogan’s integrity. As Christian reminds me, ‘white guilt obstructs the possibility of actually acknowledging or dealing with indentured black labour. The target of that slogan is whiteness; Hirst’s suite and brand.’ But I can’t help thinking about another slogan, engineered by a UK PR company in 2014, which cynically chose to exploit rather than address guilt — White Monopoly Capital. The phrase is on all of our tongues these days. Its objective is to entrench division, not resolve it. If Nurse’s barb is heartfully witty, this one is chilling. It’s the final morning of my stay. With my dog Mica in tow, I walk along the winding tarred road. Mist greets me and swirls away, the rocky flank to my right awash with mountain water. The sky steadily parts. Why be gloomy on God’s day?</description>

      <title>EXHBITION: Io Makandal&apos;s &apos;Terra Visions&apos;</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/exhbition-io-makandals-terra-visions</link>
      <description>A review by Keely Shinners for ArtThrob A couple of years ago, I was working as an assistant at a gallery. We were hosting a group show in which one of the works was to be a giant bird’s nest, sewn together out of hay from the artist’s farm, complete with several dozen handmade ceramic eggs. When the crated artwork arrived,we were somewhat irritated by its contents. The nest was dirty. It shed clumps of straw each time it was touched and left streaks of dirt on the floor and our clothes. Worst of all, though, were the bugs: muggies buzzing in our ears, fleas chowing our legs. After three days, our director had had enough. The nest was to be sent back, the eggs placed on a plinth like any normal sculpture. It was then I learned two important lessons about the commercial art world. 1) The gallery is no fit place for getting one’s hands dirty, and 2) the gallery is no fit place for living things. It was this memory which popped into my head upon visiting Io Makandal’s ‘Terra Visions’ at Everard Read. Probably because of the bugs. Not fleas – thank goodness – but a few beetles, little mites, a hairy white moth. The smell too – dry, fungal smell of rot – so out of place that to behold it was to be reminded what sterile, sense-obliterating places galleries can be. How ironically refreshing it was to have the floors blanketed in wilted flowers, dry grass, rotting leaves. Installation View Makandal takes this idea – decay as the site of activation – as her thesis for ‘Terra Visions’. In other words, it is a show about compost. A welcome impetus, I thought, as someone who is starting to consider seriously what art might look like at the end of the world. Why not turn the gallery into a compost site? Like Walter de Maria’s Earth Room, but healthier. Why not locate the archive in organic matter? As Kapwani Kiwangi did in Flowers for Africa. How cool would it be to create a compostable artwork: an artwork that grew, died, rotted, was reborn anew. Certainly, ‘Terra Visions’ makes the gallery more earthy than usual. But, as my gardener friend pointed out, compost is supposed to be hot, wet, vital. These installations, perhaps green at opening, were by now dried out, brittle; they crumple to the touch. No life will flourish here beyond microbes which eat away at the dead. Where is the alchemy? I wondered. The fertility? If decay is tangential to regeneration, what will be generated other than a backdrop for what’s framed? The gallery is no fit place for living things, I suppose. Maybe, I thought, I’m being unforgiving by interpreting the “call to action to mitigate the deadening of ground” too literally. Maybe compost is just a metaphor. The real alchemy happens when the artist integrates earthbound knowledge systems onto the page. Makandal’s gestures – scribbles, splices, smudges, overlaps, improvisations, and entanglements – gesture towards the terrestrial theatres enacting themselves, impervious to the naked eye. Still, there’s something a bit too clean about them. For instance, how the ‘Terra Vision’ pieces are cut and rearranged versions of their original drawings – imitating the sedimentary, I assume – but cut and rearranged so neatly, eliminating the element of surprise. Or the Humus pieces, which incorporate bits of brown matter – so important for compost, as they feed the microbes which turn kitchen waste into soil – these too seem too careful, too pretty, too clean, bracketed by frames custom-made to round off the rough edges. Just as a pair of mangey carpets and a few plastic tarps are keeping the installations’ dust from spreading all over the gallery, these abstract drawings portray a rather palatable mess. Installation view (Meanwhile, gardeners are shoveling compost onto the lawn outside, upon which only grass-as-backdrop for the gallery’s new sculpture garden will grow.) The gallery is no fit place for getting one’s hands dirty, I suppose. Makandal is definitely onto something. As we enter into an era of ongoing ecological catastrophe, it’s essential to fabulate strategies of both art-making and being-in-the-world which adhere more gently to earth logic, earth time, earth moods. For this particular experiment, I’m left wanting less allusion, more of what grows.</description>

      <title>An enclosure and an opening: Jeanne Gaigher&apos;s &apos;tango&apos;</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/an-enclosure-and-an-opening-jeanne-gaighers-tango</link>
      <description>An interior is a place that keeps the people inside safe from rain, wind, sunstroke, heatwave, wild animals, other people, and various threats of other kinds. Jeanne Gaigher locust, 2020. Acrylic, Ink on Canvas and Scrim An interior is a place that keeps the people inside safe from rain, wind, sunstroke, heatwave, wild animals, other people, and various threats of other kinds. It is, at least in the West, a sort of box, comprising a floor, a ceiling, four walls, at least one threshold, and objects that function, entertain or adorn. Interiors are sometimes equipped with emergency buttons, surveillance cameras, and burglar bars. This is to protect the people and the objects inside them, if not the very idea of interiority, the dialectic between inside (control) and outside (wilderness). The genre of painting called interior emerged when the bourgeoisie of 17th century Europe wanted to show off and preserve their interiors for posterity, a somewhat extreme method of exerting control over wilderness. An interior is also a psychic state. Jeanne Gaigher, low frequency, 2020. Acrylic on Canvas Jeanne Gaigher’s ‘tango’ is about what happens when the proximity between these two interiors – room and mind – results in such pressure as to render them indistinguishable. Take, for instance, her painting low frequency. In it, we recognise a bedroom – rug, headboard, duvet – but the room is all wrong. The edges of the once square and steady bed have furrowed. The floor has taken on the colour and logic of a river. Strange clouds, like smoke, or ghosts, flit in the air. It is not unlike the way my own bedroom feels after nearly a year confined inside it. A general woundedness hums at a low frequency, commiserates with the colours around me, and leaves me wounded. Clarity ripples and disappears inside a soup of memories. Objects reflect my projections and begin, as in the beauty-beast folktale, to take on a life of their own. On the wall opposite this painting, another bedroom, called vinegar. The person who sleeps here has fermented beneath the covers; the covers have dissolved to water. The bed itself has erupted into tears. Jeanne Gaigher, vinegar, 2020. Acrylic and Ink on Canvas and Scrim ‘tango’ as a show about the fungibility of interiors is also about what happens when the interior becomes a wilderness. This is a well-known tactic of the haunted house genre. The house is no longer safe; the house itself is wild. Typically, this is as a result of some trauma – murder, suicide, accidental death – as if a room could hold trauma in the same way bodies do. The past is never past. At any moment it can spring upon the present and cause ruin. Whereas trauma in a haunted house story is specific, in Gaigher’s work, what haunts is hard to pin down. There is reverb but no gesture. Bodies but no people. Not a torment on the mind, but a torment of the mind. Haunting in Gaigher’s work is nonspecific because it comes from a wilderness inside. Depression is what arises when a haunting, or a chorus of hauntings, becomes too much for the body to bear. It is a common misconception to think of depression as a pause. It is, in fact, a climax so thunderous it eclipses all life’s other goings-on. It is this climax which leads one to seek out some stillness, however binding, to feel through the crescendo. Akin to Book 12 of the Odyssey when Odysseus ties himself to a mast as they sail past the sirens. (Another misconception: sirens represent desire. They do not. They are creatures that despair). Jeanne Gaigher, are we friends again, 2020. Acrylic ink on canvas and scrim Seeking stillness, one might find oneself in bed for days, weeks, months. Sometimes the bed is too much – alive, as it can be, with too many associations – and the body takes to the floor. All of the figures in Gaigher’s show are on the floor. One is kneeling in kneel. One is lying still in and stillness. One is lying with their hips tilted towards an open window in locust. Two others, in gargled roots and ankle point, appear to have tripped over their boots and fallen down. What binds them together is a stillness which is not still, or a body which will not cooperate with stillness. In 1951, John Cage arranged to visit the acoustic laboratory at Harvard University in order to experience the world’s stillest place. After entering its soundproof anechoic chamber, all he could hear or think about was the thundering of his own body. Gaigher’s cocoon paintings visualise this sensation, where the body becomes suddenly aware of itself – breath, ribs, heart, blood – and the self dissipates. This feeling is so on the threshold between terror and relief that it is in stillness we are probably at our closest to death. Hence why, in yoga, lying still on the floor is called corpse pose. It is, ironically, or perhaps consequentially, our most healing posture. Gaigher lingers here. Similar to Gaigher’s fascination with the floor is her use of the corner. Many interior paintings have them – they trick the eye into perceiving depth – but Gaigher’s corners draw attention to themselves. In vinegar 2, the eye is pulled towards a blood-red corner on an otherwise mossy-green wall. In footnote 1, a bright blue corner strikes through ripples. are we friends again? is a painting with at least seven corners, not counting the corners of the canvas itself. As a metaphor, the corner is the place where time and space converge to explode the self. This is why the expression ‘to be put in a corner’ conveys a sense of powerlessness. So too why we might find ourselves physically in corners when we are at our most despondent, delirious, or disassociated. The corner, inversely, is also where the self is collected and redeemed; ‘to turn a corner’ is to recover. The corner is where the self breaks down, regathers, and goes back out into the world. Corners are lovely in this way. They trap us and then turn us around. That’s why painting is so enamoured with them. Even the most pared-down of abstract painters – Rauschenberg, Twombly – could not resist the allure of a four-cornered canvas, which is the allure of the bound. Many of the corners on Gaigher’s canvases are left exposed, covered only by a thin scrim screen. This gives the effect of a corner that Anne Carson might call ‘just enough boundary to the unbounded to suggest the beginning of real terror.’ Two large swathes of these scrim screens hang in the middle of the gallery. To gaze through them is to gaze through gauze. It is like looking through fog, or memory, or bad signal on an old television. It begets haunting imagery and creates the sense that one is moving through the gallery, the world, as if already distanced from it. A screen is a contronym, meaning both a word and its opposite. In this case, to reveal and to obscure. The screens which Gaigher has installed in her exhibition serve a dual function of crux and interruption, whereby the crux of the show is its interruption. The wall, porous as it may be, which comes up against your life and derails you. For many, this wall is called grief. Totally without substance and nonviolent in nature, grief nevertheless can ravage a person, a home, a community. Illness is another, which is tied to grief. Despite illness and grief being the refrain of our times, it seems we still find ourselves averse to interruption. God help those at whom the sirens scream: get out of bed, off the floor, out of the corner; there is a world of wires to cross, untruths to answer, screens to fill with faces. Visiting Gaigher’s exhibition, I got the sense that opportunities to be haunted, to be disturbed, to be wracked and undone by grief, longing, and fear – which is the only we find our way back to ourselves and each other – were becoming fewer and farther between, replaced by assurance and inertia of the next-thing. An interior is also a contronym: an enclosure and an opening. These paintings wrapped me in an opening and let me ache.

      <title>Behind the Artwork: Wim Legrand’s ‘we’re Toast!’</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/behind-the-artwork-wim-legrand-s-we-re-toast</link>
      <description>All of us are in some kind of trouble, and, recently, we’ve all been in the same kind of trouble. We are perhaps not ‘completely ruined’, but there are indications of global anxiety about just a handful of loaded topics that affect us all. Wim Legrand, We&apos;re toast!, 2020. Acrylic on canvas. Signed bottom right. Size: 60 x 80 cm. Price: R 15,000. Presented by 99 Loop Gallery. ENQUIRE. An artwork is generally published with a title, a date, a size and a price. There’ll be some information about what it was made with: crayon, oils, concrete, and if there’s a signature there’ll be directions to find it: front bottom left. But we’re curious to know more. So much of art is left to interpretation but what did the artist intend to say? What value lies in the many sketches and practice rounds they did to reach the final product? And what was happening in the world when they made it? Introducing Behind the Artwork where we zoom in on one artwork and ask the fundamental questions: who, what, when, where and how. First up is Wim Legrand and his piece ‘We’re Toast!’ made when it felt like the world was shutting down. In it a piece of toast acknowledges a universal feeling and adds a pinch of humour to our soupy dread. It was part of his recent solo show, The Parafix, at 99 Loop Gallery. Who? Wim Legrand (Cape Town) was born in Belgium in 1978. After completing his studies in Visual Arts in 2000, he honed his skills as a master printmaker at a prominent international centre for the graphic arts. His career as a painter has steadily advanced in parallel. He combines painting with drawing, cartoons and pop culture with aesthetic references to North European history painting and Surrealist traditions. His work offers a playful take on the paradoxical strangeness of everyday reality, while commenting on our postmodern condition as victims to the barrage of information and news feeds. &quot;I work on the same characters in different media, at the same time. While painting, I was refining drawings in pen and ink, producing a series of prints, and developing the toast as a lapel pin.&quot; What? Let’s talk concept. What is &apos;We&apos;re toast!’ about? The artwork takes its title from the colloquial expression ‘We’re toast’, as in, ‘to be in a lot of trouble or completely ruined’. All of us are in some kind of trouble, and, recently, we’ve all been in the same kind of trouble. We are perhaps not ‘completely ruined’, but there are indications of global anxiety about just a handful of loaded topics that affect us all. The protagonist – an open-mouthed slice of toast covering his eyes with his large cartoon hands – was designed as a symbol, an emoji almost, for a very specific feeling that became familiar to most of us recently. It’s a feeling of fear and anxiety combined with denial, disbelief and a huge desire to rather avoid the reality. It’s a psychology that relates to other works I’ve made in the past, which deal with the idea of ‘victimhood’ in the broadest sense – in that everyone feels, at certain times, as if they are victims of something. This experience ranges (almost obscenely) from being a ‘fashion-victim’ or experiencing FOMO, to being victims in a war zone, of domestic violence, or of the time we live in. The setting of a car boot is a cinematographic reference. Everyone remembers some scene in a movie where a victim is thrown into the boot of the car, left with the hope of escape or discovery by someone who might open the boot later. In my painting, the car boot isn’t closed: the scene is open-ended. There are props such as a lifebelt, a rope, a piece of wood and a spare wheel. The question remains: Will we recognise the props as aids for escape, or will we keep our eyes covered? I use the visual language of cartoons in my work because I feel it is a language that is understood across the world, one that doesn’t need words to express meaning and one that bridges cultures too. When? I made the painting after the first lockdown during the ongoing pandemic. The character came to be sometime during the first weeks of Lockdown Level 5, as a small sketch in a sketchbook. It happened almost accidentally when I was working on some other drawings in preparation for my solo. Where? I have a studio space in Paarden Eiland, an industrial area in Cape Town, where I produced the paintings as well as the drawings and sculptures. It is a small room with access to a multi-purpose workshop. The room is filled with soft sculpture versions I made of the characters, based on drawings and paintings. There are also different objects that inspire me, some older works and always a bunch of things in progress. In the picture, on the left you can see the slice of toast in an early stage. Photograph by Bernard Brand How? I always start from sketches and drawings – notes of ideas, experiences and interpretations of what I perceive daily. The majority of drawings are inspired by everyday objects and the visual language I developed from sampling memories of cartoons from my childhood. Also, most of the time, I draw from the Northern European tradition of landscape painting as a reference or inspiration for my paintings. I especially like the distorted sense of scale in those paintings, which focus on how majestic nature is. In this painting, I used a photographic vintage car reference for the scene. The car boot is the environment and is more of an impression, with very minimal, loose brushstrokes. The inside of the boot is more detailed and is separated from the exterior by a clear outline. It’s all intended to set the right atmosphere and construct a stage for the narrative. I work in acrylic, which forces me to paint fast because of the drying time. Layering is essential in the process – not just practically, but also in the construction of the concept. I am always looking for a balance between an image that evokes a sense of familiarity, something you think you might have seen before, and just the right amount of ‘What the hell am I looking at?’ I work on the same characters in different media, at the same time. While painting, I was refining drawings in pen and ink, producing a series of prints, and developing the toast as a lapel pin. I made a larger-scale soft sculpture to investigate the character’s presence in the real world. The various processes help to mature the ideas. Enquire about ‘We’re toast!’</description>

      <title>The Open Call Collection Auction</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/the-open-call-collection-auction</link>
      <description>An online auction by Latitudes and The Lockdown Collection As we approach one year of lockdown in South Africa, The Lockdown Collection (TLC) and Latitudes are proud to announce an online auction, created by 21 South African artists, the proceeds of which will go towards benefitting artists affected by the pandemic. THE BACKGROUND In April 2020, TLC curated and auctioned a collection of Covid-19-related artworks by renowned South African artists, with the proceeds going into a fund that supported artists during the lockdown. The auction was so successful that the team extended the project with The Extension Collection and then The Student Collection. To date, TLC has paid out over 500 grants – an amount of R1,5 million – from its Vulnerable Artists Fund (VAF) to artists across South Africa, as well as donated R250 000 to the President’s SA Solidarity Fund, for the benefit of all South Africans in need. Launched in July 2020, Latitudes.Online is a new online marketplace for art from Africa. With over 550 artists and thousands of works represented on the platform, it has become an indispensable resource for collectors and fans of art from Africa to buy and discover new talent from the continent. THE AUCTION Now, the two organisations have come together to host an online auction created by 21 South African artists. The Open Call Collection is the result of a beautiful synergy: TLC called for new artwork donations and submissions from South African artists, and Latitudes carefully considered each of the hundreds of submissions, selecting 21 emerging artists to contribute to the collection. PARTICIPATING ARTISTS Brendon Erasmus Charles &apos;Steroid&apos; Mamorobela Cinthia Sifa Mulanga Colijn Strydom Effo Munguanzo Fanie Buys Givan Lotz Jana+Koos Jo Roets Khanyisile Mawhayi Laura de Harde Nomvula Millicent Hoko Patrick Seruwu Puleng Mongale Sepideh Mehraban Tamara Osso Thalente Khomo Thuli Lubisi Tumisang Khalipha Vivien Kohler Zana Masombuka DISCOVER &amp; CONTRIBUTE This auction provides a rare opportunity for collectors to discover and acquire works by emerging artists, while contributing to a charitable cause. The proceeds will be split between the contributing artists, the Lockdown Collection’s Vulnerable Fund and Latitudes Outreach. The curated collection will be auctioned online from 21-23 March, 2021. It’s no accident that the team has opted to launch the auction on South Africa’s Human Rights Day. This date holds great significance; it recognises and celebrates the power that people have, for positive change. Registration opens Friday 19 March on latitudes.online And if you just can&apos;t wait, email us to place an early bid: info@latitudesartfair.com</description>

      <title>[BR]OTHER | A Visual Record of Xenophobia in SA</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/brother-a-visual-record-of-xenophobia-in-sa</link>
      <description>[BR]OTHER | A Visual Record of Xenophobia in South Africa “No African is a foreigner in Africa! No African is a migrant in Africa! Africa is where we all belong!” - Professor Achille Mbembe One of the most excruciating images in James Oatway and Alon Skuy’s new photography book, [BR]OTHER is an image of a visibly distressed man held by the scruff of his jersey on the ground surrounded by the legs and pointed fingers of a surrounding mob. He offers up his crumpled green South African ID book as proof that he’s not a foreigner to escape being physically attacked, or worse. In May and June 2008, waves of xenophobic violence swept through South Africa’s townships and informal settlements leaving more than 60 people dead, hundreds injured and tens of thousands displaced from their homes and having to find refuge in makeshift refugee camps, community halls and police stations. Acclaimed South African photojournalists Oatway and Skuy were on the ground to document the violence and the immediate aftermath. In 2021, xenophobia in South Africa continues to rise and with it the relevance for a book like [BR]OTHER published this month by Jacana Media, in partnership with The Johannesburg Holocaust &amp; Genocide Centre and Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung. [BR]OTHER is a hard look at this violence over the past twelve years. The foreword is written by former Constitutional Court Judge Justice Edwin Cameron, who writes, “This work by James Oatway and Alon Skuy instigates us to reflection, and discussion, and ultimately to action. This starts by positioning the cross-border migrant as central to a meaningful response to xenophobia. Most importantly, it dignifies imperiled bodies by allowing them to be seen. From there, we challenge ourselves to seek new, more practical ways of embracing the other in our midst. In that way, we may find, begin to find, our own humanity.” The book is also accompanied by critical texts by Achille Mbembe, Joao Silva, Justice Malala, Koketso Moeti and others. In documenting these events, the book aims to raise awareness of the dangers that lie in hatred, intolerance and indifference. It is an urgent call to action; to not ignore the warning signs. We have a small selection from [BR]OTHER here, courtesy of the photographers. The book is dedicated to all those who have been affected by violence, intolerance and hatred. Alon Skuy began work as a photographer for The Star , Saturday Star and the Sunday Independent , and later moved on to be chief photographer of The Times and Sunday Times . His work focuses on issues relating to inequality, resilience and conflict, and life on the fringes of society. Skuy is the recipient of numerous local and international awards, including a World Press Photo Award, and multiple awards from the Picture of the Year International (POYI). James Oatway is an independent South African photographer. His work revolves predominantly around themes of social inequality and people affected by conflict. He was the Chief Photographer and Picture Editor of the Sunday Times newspaper and is co-author of The Battle of Bangui (Penguin Random House, 2021). Oatway has received various international awards including multiple Pictures of the Year International (POYi) awards. In 2015 he was named the Vodacom South African Journalist of the Year. In 2018 his Red Ants project won the prestigious Visa d’or Feature Award at the Visa Pour l’image Photojournalism Festival in Perpignan, France.lat</description>

      <title>Folly, Frailty and Fear | A Virtual Walkabout with Diane Victor</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/folly-frailty-and-fear-a-virtual-walkabout-with-diane-victor</link>
      <description>Folly, Frailty and Fear | A Virtual Walkabout with Diane Victor Diane Victor Folly from Latitudes Online on Vimeo . Renowned South African artist Diane Victor ’s latest solo exhibition opens at UJ Art Gallery on the 14th of April 2021 with a live-streamed virtual walkabout with the artist at 6pm on the gallery’s Facebook page . Though a result of Covid-19 restrictions, the event will be a fortuitous opportunity for those outside of Johannesburg and around the world to join this rare occasion and pose questions to the artist. The seed for Folly, Frailty and Fear was planted for Diane Victor while reading Desiderius Erasmus’ text In Praise of Folly (1511) where the writer uses satire and social critique in the guise of humour to parody power. In those times the powers he pointed a finger at were religious. In Victor’s case, her works look instead to current times; to corruption, violence and fear. The show constitutes various bodies of work. In Praise of Folly follows Erasmus’ original characters Dame Folly and Master Fool as they enact various scenarios inspired by, as Victor told Latitudes, “the infatuation that seems to infiltrate our society, the need for flattery through one’s postings and one’s likes and dislikes on social media, and the folly of attempting to rewrite histories that cannot be changed.” The Chalkboard series is another body of work within the show. Rendered in chalk on blackboards, the works depict the lessons that our society never seems to have learned, the misjudgements and miscalculations we continue to make. The bodies of work in the exhibition are produced in a variety of mediums and experimental materials: tapestry, lithographs, the smoke drawings Victor is well-known for and drawings made on stone. Victor’s interest in exploring alternative processes is in part inspired by her years teaching; encouraging students to question their materials. In turn she’s inspired to question her own. Her smoke drawings which she began doing twenty years ago have migrated onto glass, accidentally producing shadow works when light is shone through it. The smoke drawings have also been printed on cloth producing works that are less fragile. Printed onto various surfaces inspires different readings of the works, although this isn’t necessarily Victor’s intention which is instead to play, experiment and stay open to a shift between mediums. “Different mediums give back in ways you don’t expect and it’s that unexpected potential that I try to use to move me out of my safe comfort zones,” she says. Working on stone is a new direction seen in this show. Victor uses sandstone polished down to a fine finish to draw on. “Working on the stones and drawing on the stones came from the visual seduction or the physical seduction of drawing on litho stones which is perhaps one of the most beautiful surfaces to actually draw on. I can fully understand why palaeolithic man drew on stone walls,” she says. Image: Diane Victor at Atelier le Grand Village Victor’s hopes for this show are what she hopes for any body of work she creates: to be a mirror for the society she is part of, reflecting back on itself laced with cynical humour. “I think I’m too cynical to labour under the illusion that an artwork can offer hope to the viewer,” she says. “I think a vaccine rollout programme that functioned would offer hope to a viewer, the return of monies leached from our society — millions stolen from the poorest people in the country, returned and some kind of prosecution port would inspire hope. A solution or attempted solution to the horrific attacks and murders of women in our society produces hope. An artwork presuming to do this would be a little grandiose. As a maker sometimes I think of myself as being a small seismograph that just attempts to measure the disruptions. If anything, an early warning system or an alarm bell that just gets stuck on in a society so well-skilled in, not necessarily indifference, but the ability to sublimate the things around them and just continue. Hopefully drawings offer that reflected world. Perhaps seeing it from a different angle you see a little bit more clearly for a short while.” Folly, Frailty and Fear will be on show at UJ Art Gallery from the 14th of April until the 19th of May 2021, and virtually on their digital platform Moving Cube until May 2022.

      <title>Joburg Alight in Sibusiso Gcaba’s Street Photography</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/joburg-alight-in-sibusiso-gcaba-s-street-photography</link>
      <description>Joburg Alight in Sibusiso Gcaba&apos;s Street Photography “Everything I know I learned in the city; the streets taught me.” Many people have endeavoured to describe the particular energy of Johannesburg but photographer Sibusiso Gcaba doesn’t try; he just shoots. Joburg is the city that raised him. “Everything I know I learned in the city; the streets taught me,” he says. In return he’s giving back by bestowing importance on its everyday hum through his lens. His series K’se Goli La (This is Joburg), made between 2017 and 2020, takes its name from the isiZulu phrase usually used to caution of its dangers. “In a place where everyone is on the move to get their own, and space and resources are limited, the environment tends to get hostile and you are forced to move swiftly to find your way or be absorbed by the chaos,” Gcaba writes in his artist statement. “But I&apos;m still fascinated by the moments between her breaths.” His photographs press pause on the relentless reel of the city. “I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a good city to shoot in,” he says “But I have a unique relationship with it, and it was very important for me to create the K&apos;se Goli La project. Specifically in the inner city/CBD. I owed it to the city.” Gcaba’s street photography of Joburg captures the specific light of a city that’s bounced off glass facades to illuminate an otherwise commonplace scene or interaction. It’s as if each of his photographs is lit by a bevy of technicians and yet they’re all captured on the fly. He uses the available light and the shadows that it strikes to his advantage. To be ever-ready to capture the happenings around him, Gcaba used to carry his camera at all times. It was important while he was learning to anticipate a moment. Now that he knows what he’s looking for, he goes out at certain times to shoot. Although he admits, “sometimes it hurts to see a once in a lifetime image dissolve in front of you.” Gcaba heads out most often in the late afternoons when the light turns golden and rush hour begins. “That&apos;s when the city is more alive and everyone is pacing up and down and anything can happen,” he says. “But you know what they say about luck on the streets, you create it.” When out shooting in Joburg, Gcaba says he is forced to move with the crowd in order to blend in. But certain moments call for stillness. “Especially if you can smell the moment, you have to wait,” he says. The best tip he’s learnt from studying the greats of street photography is to be present. “Being present helps you to calculate and predict moments before they happen,” he says. It also helps to stay aware of his surroundings; he’s had people screaming at him for pointing his camera in their direction and others who have tried to rob him. “But there&apos;s also love,” he says, “people want to know what you are shooting for, and they want to follow your work.” Gcaba is drawn to slow moments in the midst of chaos. More than what it looks like, he hopes to portray what a scene feels like. Through his images you can feel the bite of a crisp winter morning or the heat rising off black, sun-baked tar that would scorch bare feet. Capturing the feeling of the city became especially vivid during lockdown when the city changed its spots. “I still went out to shoot occasionally during lockdown,” Gcaba says, “but my approach was different because everything just felt and looked weird. Most of the work I created during lockdown is a bit heavy. I saw myself slowing down. I was taking my time with the images, so what I produced wouldn&apos;t fall under traditional street photography. Though I think these genres will become less and less relevant as time goes on. People just want to express themselves.” Street photography will always feel like a privilege for Gcaba: “I got to experience the energy of a city other than just living in it.” But his current work is aimed at diversifying his practice. He’s exploring; something the city has taught him well. Through his observations of the CBD, has he found a way to ultimately describe Johannesburg’s essence? “There&apos;s no truth about Joburg besides your personal experience,” he concludes.

      <title>Behind the Artwork: Jenny Nijenhuis &apos;This is South Africa&apos;</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/behind-the-artwork-jenny-nijenhuis-this-is-south-africa</link>
      <description>Behind the Artwork: Jenny Nijenhuis &apos;This is South Africa&apos; Jenny Nijenhuis , This is South Africa , Underwear, cotton, steel rod and brackets. Presented by Lizamore &amp; Associates . ENQUIRE . In 2016, Jenny Nijenhuis created SA’s Dirty Laundr y, a public installation made up of 3600 pairs of used panties hung on washing lines across the streets of Johannesburg. The project brought awareness to the issue of rape in South Africa and the estimated 3600 rapes that take place in the country daily. In 2018, using underwear donated by rape survivors for SA’s Dirty Laundry , she created a large South African flag to be hung upside down and titled the work This is South Africa . In 2021, tragically and infuriatingly, the artwork is still as relevant as when it was first conceptualised five years ago. Here Jenny lets us into the ‘making of’ This is South Africa , an artwork that asks us to take a hard look at ourselves as a society. Who? Jenny Nijenhuis (born 1969) is a contemporary South African artist known for her sculpture and public installation work. Nijenhuis obtained her BAFA (hons) from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1993, and subsequently developed conceptual thinking practices through strategic marketing and brand dynamics studies whilst working on brand strategy in the corporate sector. Having run her own integrated communications agency for 13 years, she returned to her art practice part time in 2012, finally becoming a fully practicing artist in 2018. Her years spent in communications combined with an intrinsic desire to understand human identity and how it’s influenced by religious, political, and societal dogma, led to her current artistic exploration. What? This is South Africa is an enormous flag in the South African colours. Hung upside down in accordance with the international communication protocol signalling distress, the flag is made from underwear and panties donated by rape survivors to my 2016 project, SA’s Dirty Laundry . The SA’s Dirty Laundry installation is a commentary on love, power and the estimated 3600 rapes that take place in South Africa daily. Questioning the state of our unhealed nation more than 25 years after the end of apartheid, the flag is an incisive, disturbing reflection on the pain and anger that inform expressions of masculinity in South Africa — and its underbelly of sexual violence. My work addresses issues of isolation, vulnerability, manipulation, gender, and the female experience, it is about how we identify and use our belief systems to support our personal views. My artistic practice has led me down a path to understand why there is violence. Much of my research points to an introduction to violent behaviour originating in the home and social environment first. In communities with deeply entrenched beliefs around male superiority and male entitlement to sex, the likelihood of sexual violence taking place is greatly increased along with a general tolerance within the community for sanctioning sexual assault. The situation in South Africa has added complexity around loss of freedom, racism through apartheid and a long legacy of violence. This project remains highly relevant given that as of Monday April 6, 2020, 90 countries were in hard lockdown. Four billion of the world’s 7.8 billion people sheltered at home to protect against Covid-19. Behind closed doors, the increase in reported violence in South Africa, specifically sexual violence with an intimate partner, became known as the “shadow pandemic” (Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women). A global estimate anticipated that 61 million more cases of intimate partner violence was expected in 2020 for an average lockdown duration of a year at that time. Lifeline SA chief executive Molefi Takalo said that the number of GBV distress calls shot up from 12 000 to almost 80 000 following the first week of lockdown. This highlights the intensity with which womxn and girls are abused, and most often by those close to us within our communities, families, and way of life. Our current modes of socialisation rely on the masculine perspective, the masculine experience, and the overwhelmingly loud masculine universal voice. A voice which tells us that boys and men are more and that girls and womxn are less… less capable, less intelligent, less powerful and have less worth. For me, this flag is an attempt to show how our beliefs lead to stereotypical behaviour patterns which keep us trapped in binary opposition and result in acts which cast us in conformity or complacency and result in lonely crowds and the radical absence of freedom. The artwork title “This is South Africa” plays on “This is America” by American rapper Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). This is South Africa in London. When? I started work on This is South Africa in late 2018 having been through a period when I was physically unable to sculpt due to a lower back injury resulting in spinal surgery. I completed the flag in July 2019. During this time, I was invited to Cornell University in New York to present the Keynote address at an event on the empowerment of womxn around the world. The flag was exhibited at Guns &amp; Rain gallery in 2019 as part of a womxn-artists’ show called Suffrage and was hung with permission from the South African High Commissioner to the United Kingdom outside the High Commission on Trafalgar Square in October 2019 to coincide with a protest against gender-based violence. Where? I worked on SA’s Dirty Laundry and This is South Africa at my then studio in Sandringham, Johannesburg. My husband and I built the studio onto the back of an adjacent property from our home when I decided to return to my artistic practice in 2011. My studio became a peaceful and secluded sanctuary for me, a place where anyone looking would usually find me. I work in a very isolated way and enjoy my privacy and solitude. The studio consisted of a large open space of about 80 square metres with an adjoining meditation room, storage area, wet room, and separate office space. The main studio opened out onto my veggie garden with an enormous old avo tree and our beehives. Crates of panties in Jenny&apos;s studio How? I am constantly reading, researching, and evolving conceptual ideas through a process known as metacognitive mapping. I create and use these maps as a way of laying down my thoughts over extended periods — they support the ability to continually circle back, add more or take away what is not making sense. Metacognition is described as thinking about one’s thinking, my maps assist me with this through a kind of visual sound board which allows me to plan, organise and assess my understanding of a concept. For This is South Africa I created many smaller maps exploring the various conceptual angles and then consolidated them into a single A1 format. Once I had decided what I was going to do, I downloaded the South African flag template off the internet to get the correct layout and proportions according to provided guidelines. I then mapped out the flag to scale on my studio floor with a permanent marker. I found references to the correct pantone colours for each section and selected panties from the 3600 that I have in crates. I started with the black triangle on the side of the flag sewing one pair of panties at a time until I had the correct shape and size. I continued in this way for each colour band until I had the separate areas and then sewed them all together to create the flag. Enquire about This is South Africa .</description>

      <description>Latitudes CuratorLab: A Practice-Based, Online Residency Latitudes is excited to announce CuratorLab, a practice-based, online curatorial residency for emerging curators in South Africa. CuratorLab takes the format of a facilitated online residency. It is designed to offer practical experience in the industry and to hone the curatorial skills of young curators. As one of the few programmes offered for curators in South Africa, it will allow for participating candidates to plan and conceptualise their own show to be hosted on Latitudes Online. The first CuratorLab boasts a varying selection of emerging curators from across the country. Our aim was to reach emerging talent from beyond the confines of the usual art hubs, as candidates in these areas can&apos;t necessarily access this sort of programming. We are thrilled to announce the 2021 CuratorLab participants: Zanele Limambo (Mpumalanga) Bontle Tau (Free State) Motlalepula Phukubje (Western Cape) Boitumelo Makouso (North West Province) Litemba Mpambani (Eastern Cape) Lesole Tauatswala (Gauteng) Jordan Cassidy (KwaZulu-Natal) Chelsea Selvan (Gauteng) S&apos;nothile Gumede (Western Cape) The programme will unfold over the month of May and culminate in the launch of the curator&apos;s projects. Keep a lookout here and on our social media channels for conversations and interviews with the CuratorLab participants.</description>

      <title>&quot;Interesting things happen on the edge.&quot; | An Interview with LR Vandy</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/interesting-things-happen-on-the-edge-an-interview-with-lr-vandy</link>
      <description>&quot;Interesting things happen on the edge.&quot; | An Interview with LR Vandy Close-up: &apos;Heavy is the Head That Wears the Crown&apos; installation A few years back British artist LR Vandy was rummaging around a car boot sale and came across the old hull of a model sailboat. Turning it over in her hands she noticed the underside looked like an African mask. A maker all her life, she knew she wanted to do something with it. Today she’s most well-known for the many hulls she’s stripped, painted and embellished with anything from metal spikes to horse hair. The beautiful, precious objects are a lure of sorts for considering painful subjects of migration; historically through the Atlantic slave trade and currently the many people making desperate, treacherous boat journeys in hopes of a safer life. The romance of sail boats is thrown into uncomfortable contrast with exploitation and trafficking. Inspired by her Nigerian heritage, Vandy sees the masks as guardians. Vandy’s first ever exhibition of these works was in 2018 with October Gallery at 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in London. It was a sell-out show. Her first sale in the art world was to the British Museum. Transformed by Vandy, each hull contains suggestions of her previous careers as a jewellery designer — she created pieces for John Galliano and did all the jewellery for the David Bowie film, Labyrinth — a set designer for major televised events like the MTV Awards, and a furniture design graduate. Alongside her sought-after hull artworks, Vandy produces larger scale pieces like her sculpture Superhero Cog Woman which will be on show in Kensington this summer. “There aren’t enough sculptures of women in any city anywhere,” she’s said. Vandy is generous when talking about her work and laughs often. ““There’s got to be humour,” she’s said before. “It’s too painful otherwise.” We chatted about what her previous lives add to her art, if she’ll keep making hulls and people’s sometimes hilarious interpretations of her work. Can I ask why you go by LR instead of Lisa? Because I was a production designer in television and commercials and live events so I had a website with my name Lisa Vandy on it and I wanted to make a new identity as an artist. I was quite interested in it being gender-free in a way. I remember when we were young, it was very fashionable to always have a Penguin book in your pocket and in those days the authors were always R.S. this and D.W. that. I thought that would be great because no-one would know whether I was male or female. I like the idea of people not knowing who the work’s made by because people do have biases, I’m afraid. It’s quite nice to feel free looking at something not knowing. When did you first become interested in making African masks? You’ve mentioned the masks being guardians. Yes that’s how I see them. I make other types of work as well, obviously. But it was coming across a boat hull in a car boot sale. To me it looked like an African mask. It just had it all. But that sat with me for probably two years before I actually did something with it. I found it very exciting. But also it’s important for me that there’s some sort of tension there. Yes, I’m interested in how you use beauty. When you’re transforming boat hulls into masks, do you do this to turn something devastating into something beautiful and meaningful or do the beautiful objects rather draw people in and then they’re met with the meaning of the works which address challenging topics? It’s probably the latter, once you’ve drawn people in they have to start questioning. Once they’re in, they’re in, aren’t they? And then they can start their own thoughts and travels in their heads around it all. But yes I think it’s a useful tool to draw people in to talk about larger and slightly more challenging subjects. Claret and Brass , Wood and metal, 2019. Presented by October Gallery . ENQUIRE . What keeps you making more hull artworks? What keeps you interested in it? I’m a maker, I love to make, I think it’s human. I think we have these amazing hands and when we make we feel good. I can’t stop making them, the subject is still worth exploring. We’re talking about slavery and it doesn’t have to be 18th/19th century slavery, we still have slavery today. All my work is motivated politically. I feel it’s important that women’s voices are out there all the time, the power of women’s voices is recognised. But I also like to talk about transportation, I have railway pieces as well, because I think again this is a place where the sort of underbelly of life is hidden, isn’t it? I really am showing you the underbelly of the hull because that’s the bit you never see. And it’s definitely not something that will be neatly wrapped up in one series and that’s that. No! That’s a good point. It’s a forever subject, absolutely. Listen if people keep wanting them, I will keep making them for sure. As long as I can keep making other pieces. It’s just what I do now, I just go to the studio and that’s what I do! It’s like a compulsion, I’m afraid. Would you ever make the hulls yourself or do they lose meaning if they’re not used before? I can get hulls built or made but there’s no need. They’re still out there. I have a dealer who deals in model boats but he says it’s really drying up now. But I’ve got a big collection. Some of them are 6 feet high so I buy what I can and store them in a container. But they’re beautiful objects. You couldn’t not go for them on their own let alone when I’m finished with them. They’re beautiful, beautiful crafted objects. I’m interested in the materials you use to transform the hulls, are these conceptual as well as visual? They are both. They have to have meaning. I’m working on a series at the moment which is this flotilla piece which sort of comes off another piece which is called Pomp and Circumstance . The idea is that it’s a showing of the wealth, a showing of plunder basically, showing off your gold. All the precious resources that you’ve taken from somewhere else. There’s a slight shame in it in my mind. But again I’m using gold, brass chain, quite intricate jewellery-type pieces that sort of seem encrusted onto the boat hulls. So that’s another direction I’m going into at the moment. They’ll always have a spiky, slightly aggressive flavour to them as well to make it more unsettling. To make you think. &apos;All that Glistens&apos; No.1 - 21 Pomp and Circumstance , Wood and metal. Presented by October Gallery . ENQUIRE . You’ve also spoken about some of the works just being fun. That it’s important to have humour. Can you tell me more about how you use humour? I think it’s just always been present in my life. I grew up as the only Black person in the village. And if you haven’t got a sense of humour then, woah! Yeah I think it’s just something that’s always been part of my personality. And I can see the humour in things, there’s no reason why that’s not going to come through in what I make. So yeah you can have a laugh too. Some of the pieces are quite comical but it doesn’t mean they’re not beautiful or political or challenging. They can contain multitudes. Yeah. It’s interesting to me as well, once you’ve handed over a piece of art to a gallery then other people bring all their stuff to it. And there’s a point where you start to get lost between what you’ve said and what they’ve said because it’s all relevant. I had the most hilarious thing happen. When I had my sell out show at 1:54 I had a whole series of women in their forties, not talking to me but looking at me knowing I’m the artist and winking because of course what they saw was giant vaginas. And then it becomes vagina dentata with all the spikes. I just couldn’t stop laughing, I thought that was perfect. Yes! That is so good. Just a wink, I loved it. I love that there are strong visual clues in your work of all the things you’ve done before: jewellery design, set design, furniture. Yeah, that’s very satisfying for me to bring all the skills together and of course it also ties in with the fact that my father was a design engineer so he was always making. Making’s always been around me so I’ve always felt confident in it. And then becoming a set designer. I was initially a prop maker and then I moved my way up because I could do technical drawing. So I saw stuff made. I worked on the MTV Awards for years as the art director so I saw giant sets being made. I worked on the Commonwealth Games. And then having done the jewellery in my twenties. All those skills come together. It’s amazing, it shows a whole lifetime of craft. Yeah I mean I felt very anxious about making people aware that I’d had another career but I am the result of my past so there’s no point hiding it. And you know, you’re the first person who’s said that, but once you know that it’s so obvious. In your latest works, All that Glistens and Heavy Is The Head That Wears The Crown what was the idea behind presenting the hulls together as a flotilla? Well basically my hull dealer rang me up and said I have 50 little hulls here, do you want them? And I went, yeah! God they were in a mess, they were dirty, dented, keelless. Anyway I fixed them up and was looking at them on the floor and suddenly realised, my god, it’s a flotilla, of course it is. I made one flotilla that’s sold as one piece of 21 hulls and one that can be sold separately. Is there anything else you’re working on that’s in development? Yes, I’m working on a woman sculpture called Dynamo . She’s a powerful force of nature. And she’s defending the land on a beach front. That’s where she belongs. And we know that interesting things in life happen on the edge of things, on the borders of things and the beach is the perfect borderland. And women traditionally occupy that space, you know mermaids, fisherwomen, loads of myths: Yemoja, the goddess of the rivers from Nigeria. These women should act as reminders of the powerful force of nature and how we have to work with it and not against it. Static, she’s a protector, but should she turn to life and start whirling round then she’s a highly destructive force. In my mind it’s a recognition that we need to be constantly aware of climate change. And the powerful force of nature, and the fact, of course, that she is a woman. I’ve got Superhero Cog Woman going into a show in Kensington for the summer, in Holland Park. She has six other sisters. She’s basically adaptable, like women are, she’s made of components. So if I switch the components round I can get a different figure. Would you like to see her in a permanent place? Oh my god. I want her and all her sisters, nieces, aunts all together dancing. Because they’re cogs they go together and they move around each other. That’s the suggestion. They’re in a dance. But don’t forget they are superheroes so they are about to spin off at any moment and do something wonderful. That’s what superheroes do isn’t it? Yes, save the world! Yeah! And how wonderful to have that as a statue in the central part of a city. It would be wonderful . Superhero Cog Woman #01 , 2019. Edition of 7, Jesmonite and steel.

      <description>A Sudanese Artist’s Journey to Find His Place in the World Mary Corrigall meets with Hussein Salim on the occasion of his largest solo exhibition in Joburg Hussein Salim says the journey of an artist is to find his place in the world. Salim’s place is in South Africa. Picture by Clint Strydom Very little has been written about the artist Hussein Salim. It is surprising given he has been exhibiting frequently in South Africa, his artworks sell out at art fairs and in London-based auctions and they present a unique abstract aesthetic. The fifty-something Sudanese artist attributes the paucity of texts about him to his terrible grasp on English. He has shied away from interviews. In truth, the unique turn of phrases he utters and his economy of language in relaying the essence of his life-journey – there are no spare words for idle chatter – add to his charm and make his story more compelling. In some ways it is a familiar story. Far too many African artists have had to leave their native countries to become and remain artists. However, the way in which Salim has found success and acceptance in a country with a reputation for xenophobia – largely targeted at African nationals – is refreshing. Uplifting even. His largest solo exhibition in South Africa, The Garden of Carnal Delights , which opened at the Melrose gallery in Joburg last week, presents a landmark of sorts. It is the culmination of a series of fortuitous twists and turns since he left his hometown in Sudan in the late nineties. On paper Salim was not in any way destined to be an artist. Born into a poor family of 13 children there was pressure to pursue a stable income and career. “It was a day of big conflict in my home,” recalls Salim of the occasion he revealed his ambitions to be an artist to his father. “You are kidding,” was his father’s response. Convincing his father that he had a talent worth pursuing was just one of the barriers. There was also the fact that the rural village of Karim, where he grew-up was an actual desert and a cultural one too. There was no access to books, images or art. The internet had not arrived either. It seems almost impossible that someone would grow up aspiring to be an artist in such a context, but, conversely it seems to have shaped Salim’s proclivity for images. “I grew up surrounded by emptiness. Total emptiness. I never saw an apple until I was seven years old. I knew they existed but didn’t know what it might look like, is it square does it have stripes? That kind of emptiness and poorness allows us to imagine things because we don’t have it in front of our eyes,” says Salim. Not only did this absence of visual references feed his imagination and desire to draw but it also set him on a path of abstraction which has marked his art ever since. Hussein Salim’s Ante-chamber (2020). Courtesy Melrose Gallery There are a vast range of works on The Garden of Carnal Delights , in different palettes and marked by varying abstract patterns. In Ducklings , all manner of motifs recalling letters of the alphabet, animals, fish and wheels, swirl around a leaning figure and two orbs. This should make for chaotic scene yet all the objects somehow are suspended in a balanced composition. A work titled Francis is delivered through a much more muted palette, pinks, pale blues, which suits the layer upon layer of details, patterns, upon patterns. This large body of works are all more or less united by Salim’s distinctive language, which remains abstract, though the shadows of human figures keep them somehow grounded in a hazy landscape. He has never painted a traditional landscape. “I never saw a tree or river until I was much older. That is why I started with abstraction.” His proclivity for abstraction proved somewhat of a challenge for the lecturers at the University of Sudan in Khartoum, where he studied fine art. “In a traditional education you begin with figurative works and then you can start to make abstract works.” The other battle Salim had on his hands was a financial one. To remain in art school and buy materials he had to sell his art straight-away. He discovered pretty quickly that the Sudanese do not value art. “To be an artist in Sudan is a sin – is a social sin, a mistake. I mean it. We had a fundamental Islamic regime holding the power and marry that with a bad economic situation. We had a good school of arts but it is being demolished day by day. That place is seen as the devil’s place in the fundamentalist regime mindset,” he observes. It was in the staff of foreign embassies that Salim found what he describes as “an army of good people supporting my journey.” It was through one of these clients that led a German art dealer to Salim’s home in search of his art. The result of this connection was a touring exhibition in Germany in the late 1990s. Hussein Salim’s Ducklings (2021). Courtesy Melrose Gallery He never returned to Sudan, save for brief visits. This wasn’t only due to more promising opportunities elsewhere but a deep and painful recognition that his art would never be appreciated in his homeland. This message was driven home in the year of his graduation, when he held a small exhibition at the Hilton hotel in Khartoum. Much to his surprise the current prime minister of Sudan was holding talks with foreign businessmen in the hotel. Thinking this might be an opportunity to secure a patron from the highest echelons he connived a meeting with the leader in the corridor where his art was hanging. “He looked at the price tag and he asked me why it was so expensive. I was shocked. The Turkish guy standing behind him, bought that work. I realised then that people out of my country appreciate my art.” This painful realisation saw Salim embrace a peripatetic existence, largely moving around Europe – Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Norway – exhibiting and selling his art. He wanted however to settle in an English-speaking country with warm weather. Australia was first on his list but a long wait in Cairo to secure a meeting for a visa made him consider South Africa. He knew he had made the right choice when the woman at the visa office wavered the fees and warmly welcomed him to the country. He has been settled in Pietermaritzburg with his family since 2004. It has taken time for his art to circulate and gain attention but he has been carried by committed collectors in this country since his arrival. “South Africans have a unique taste in art. This might be due to its complex history. They know how to collect art and when you put something new in front of them they recognise it immediately. In one year I did better here than 10 years in Europe,” he says. The most profound influence on his work came from an encounter at a Jewish primary school he visited in Germany. He was struck by the children’s acute awareness to survive and be accepted in the world. “This is the journey of the artist. The Jewish child feels that he is standing against the wind, that produces abstract art and is born from his situation in Germany,” says Salim. Being an artist is intrinsically going to be tied to a narrative of survival and “finding your place in the world,” says Salim. Interestingly, Salim has found his place in the world via an aesthetic defined by the multitude of cultures he has encountered through his wanderings in Europe. This has been married with a vibrant palette and filtered through layers of patterns, shapes and motifs that are drawn from different cultures. Perhaps it is South Africans desire for a multicultural utopia that allows his art to resonate here. Or perhaps it is his ability to imagine a world beyond what the naked eye can see. – African Art Features Agency funded by the National Arts Council in South Africa.

      <title>K.Skit’s Three Balloons Embraces the Gift of Life Beyond Trauma</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/k-skit-s-three-balloons-embraces-the-gift-of-life-beyond-trauma</link>
      <description>K.Skit’s Three Balloons Embraces the Gift of Life Beyond Trauma The self-taught artist’s multimedia series uses balloons to convey the quest for joy and freedom in the midst of struggle, writes Sandiso Ngubane With balloons on his head, K.Skit explores how Black people often find healing and joy in spite of the generational and ongoing trauma inherited from historical oppression. In Paris is Burning , the 1990 film chronicling the New York City ball culture, one of its subjects speaks on being Black and gay in America. ”I remember my dad telling me you have three strikes against you in this world,” he says. “Every Black man has two – being Black and being a man. You are Black, you’re a man and you’re gay. If you’re going to do this, you’re going to have to be stronger than you have ever imagined.” It’s no different for queer Black men everywhere. Escaping the reality of what you’re up against in the world – specifically racism and homophobia – sometimes means conducting yourself in a way that makes you more ‘palatable’, as artist K.Skits puts it. The 20-year-old from Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, recently debuted a body of work titled The Three Balloons under the auspices of Bubblegum Club’s Bubblegum Invites incubator. The initiative was established by the youth culture journal to support emerging artists by providing them with studio space and the resources necessary to bring their work to life. Born Kgotlelelo Bradley Sekiti, K.Skit’s series explores the “the generational and ongoing traumas of Black bodies; the everyday experiences of queer Black bodies and (the) Black body’s ability to embrace the gift of life through celebration”. K.Skits wears an afro symbolising blackness and a white shirt as commentary on the sanitisation of blackness he says artists are often cornered into by the palatability requirements of the white gaze. “My experience as a Black and queer person; there’s a lot of trauma but somehow, even with that trauma we are able to find reasons to celebrate. That’s what the balloons are about,” he explains. “It’s a symbol of celebration. Black people are incredible artists. This is how we find joy and healing. We share that with the world but beyond that, this work is about reclaiming my identity.” The artist adds that too often Black artists are forced into a space where they have to ‘perform blackness’ for the white gaze. “What we do has to be palatable. You have to think about how to be Black and acceptable at the same time because we exist in a world that doesn’t like us. For me, this is about being unapologetically Black without having to put on a performance of what that is for someone else.” In the accompanying images, some shot on green screen rendered as a red background, K.Skits wears balloons covering his face. In others he wears an afro as a representation of blackness. “There are images where I’m wearing all-white; looking clean. That’s about the palatability we’re forced into but this also interacts with my queer experience so I’m half naked. Often, as queer Black men we are seen as meat. If we’re not being sexualised, we are kept around for clout or we constantly have to educate. In one way or another, we’re being taken from or our culture is being appropriated and exploited. The beans (in the one painting) symbolise the fact that some see blackness as a product you can get off the shelf. You choose how to consume that product whichever way you like.” The artists contends that in art blackness is often packaged in stereotypes that confirm biases rather than allowing Black people to freely express themselves The Three Balloons comes at a time when the news cycle is filled with reports of hate crimes perpetrated against Black gay men all over South Africa. Sphamandla Khoza, a 24 year old, was stabbed to death in Ntuzumu near Durban, and his body was found in a ditch near his home; in the Eastern Cape, Andile “Lulu” Nthulela, 40, disappeared for a week before his body was found buried at the home of a suspect; in Gauteng, Nathaniel Spokane’s body was found lifeless, with stab wounds in the chest. Reports say these are just three of many such cases, with at least one being reported every month for the last year. It’s clear that in spite of the country’s celebrated recognition of queer rights as espoused in the Constitution, the reality on the ground for most queer Black men remains bleak at best. It’s difficult to look at K.Skit’s work outside of this context. In ‘Mmele’ one of the videos from the series, K.Skits can be seen vogueing - a type of dance that is synonymous with New York City’s ball culture as seen in Paris is Burning . ‘Mmele’ means body in the artist’s native Sepedi language and the vogueing, drawn straight out of Paris is Burning , is characterised by hand gestures and body movements the artist sees as an apt depiction of liberation and the conjuring of alternative universes where his emancipation is not tethered to any particular gaze outside of his own. The queer ball scene informing K.Skit’s ideas around liberation has become popular around the world as an outlet for queer youth in their quest for ‘safe spaces’ within which to express their queerness outside of the hetero-patriarchal norms of modern society. They often dress in drag and participate in dance-offs for a predominantly queer audience as a way of escaping the norms that often render their identity and expressions undesirable – or unpalatable. As the artist notes, the rejection of queerness within Black communities and society at large, not only makes it difficult for many to exist without fear, it strips one of identity and often leaves queer youths to find alternative communities and ways of celebrating who they are. “Traditional dancing is not my experience and a lot of Black sub-cultures are not relevant to my experience,” the artist says of their decision to use vogueing as an expression of that identity rather than, say, a traditional African dance or minno was setšo (indigenous African music). “When I was in high school, I discovered Paris is Burning and I binged it for a week because I identified with that desire for free expression. I took from it how free people in the film were when they were on the ballroom floor but I also just like viewing the world as a stage. You can create an alternative universe of your own through art and performance.” The work Outrage by K.Skit touches on the manner in which ‘blackness’ is packaged and consumed and made palatable for the white gaze. A self-taught artist, K.Skits has been dancing as early as eight years old. After a few years of doing sports in school, he eventually joined the drummies – or drum majorettes – and continued to dance through high school. After matriculating and finding an internship doing social media at Wits University, K.Skit’s became interested in photography and began to experiment with self-portraiture and making short dance videos on his smartphone. The Three Balloons marks a continued expansion of this expression. He adds of his interest in art and ever developing multi-disciplinary practice that also includes DJ’ing: “Art feels to me like something that gives me room to express and create universes that don’t exist. It allows me to communicate in a different way, on my own terms and to create a different version of myself.” - African Art Features Agency funded by the National Arts Council of South Africa.</description>

      <title>The Nature of NIROX Artist Residency</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/the-nature-of-nirox-artist-residency</link>
      <description>The Nature of NIROX Artist Residency “It’s a place where art happens.” A 2015 study in Denmark found a link between nature and creative thinking; that nature plays a role especially in the preparation and incubation phase of the creative process. But it doesn’t take a study to know the sprawling natural wonder of the NIROX Foundation is the perfect setting for an artist residency. According to Founder Benji Liebmann, it was “the ambiance of the property, its existing buildings and a commitment to make a difference through the arts” that prompted the conversation to invite artists to spend time there. Located in the Cradle of Humankind, west of Johannesburg, NIROX is best known for its Sculpture Park ; 30 hectares of cultivated lawns, arbors, fields, waterways and wetlands open on weekends and public holidays. It’s home to over 50 permanent and long-term installations by local and international artists. The Residency is an extension of this close relationship with artists from across the world who come to stay for usually 6 to 8 weeks. Beyond visual art, the Residency welcomes artists from across creative fields; musicians, dancers, theatre-makers or writers. Local musicians Msaki and Tubatsi Mpho Moloi recently completed a workshop residency with French cellist Clement Petit. Residents at NIROX are encouraged to interact and collaborate with each other to create compelling experiences. “My experience with NIROX has been so amazing and so educational because of all the artists I’ve had an opportunity to work with,” Moloi says. “Artists of all different disciplines, not only in music but sculptors, writers, dancers, poets. It’s been so advantageous for my career.” There are no rules to who can apply. “It’s an imperfect, natural, conversational process,” Liebmann says. “Mostly artists apply by writing to us, but we also approach them when there is a reason. Our network has grown organically.” This year, the Residency is host to Claudia Kubler and David Knuckey from Switzerland, Tawanda Takura from Zimbabwe and Sadie Clayton from the UK, among many others. Future residents are arriving from India, Angola and Germany. “Although the Residency is private, most artists are open to visits or conversations arranged through our curatorial staff”, Liebmann says. The public can attend occasional studio shows and open studios, news of which is published to the various Nirox online and social platforms. When they depart, each artist leaves a work of their choice for archival purposes. “The Foundation is not a collector,” Liebmann says, “It’s a place where art happens.” Every effort is made in ensuring artists have everything they need to create — from assistance with sourcing materials to various studio spaces to work from, a sculpture workshop and a screening room. Besides the grounds of the Foundation, artists in residence can access the adjoining 1000 hectare Khatlhaphi Private Nature Reserve and its diverse local game and birdlife. “It’s a wonderful space to be creative and to write from,” Moloi says. “It’s such an amazing and beautiful space.” The wide open space has inspired some breakthroughs. Artist Yolanda Mazwana stayed in February and besides taking on new concepts in her art, spent time visualising her future. “My residency at NIROX was simply aspirational for my next level of accomplishments, in seeing what else is out there, which I felt I needed not just in my art practice but also at the stage I am in my life,” she says. “There are no limits to how far life and art can take you. You just have to see the big picture and be assertive. I had a moment that felt like deja vu and I realized more than before I was on the right path.” Whether spending a morning in the Sculpture Park, an afternoon at a visiting artist’s open studio, or spending 6 weeks creating new material, it’s difficult to leave NIROX uninspired.

      <title>African Spiritualism is the Focus of a New Generation of Artists</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/african-spiritualism-is-the-focus-of-a-new-generation-of-artists</link>
      <description>African Spiritualism is the Focus of a New Generation of Artists African traditions are moving into the mainstream, writes Nolan Stevens. Yonela Makoba , uVuma oMhlophe , 2020. (120 cm x 105 cm) Edition: 1/7. Standard ink on fine art canvas. Currently showing in Re-Curators&apos; Past Present Currents at AVA Gallery. “I am not African because I was born in Africa, but because Africa was born in me.” I’m reminded of these words from revolutionary Ghanaian president, Kwame Nkrumah, when it dawns on me that we could be at the beginning of a rethinking of South African visual arts culture – relating not only to how we conceive of our art as visual creators but also how we as audiences experience it. South African artists, especially those of the current younger generation are making the shift from existing in spaces where we saw ourselves as secondary to the rest of the world, to finally inhabiting spaces where we are unashamed of putting our African perspectives and views out into the world. There are at least three groups of young artists remixing the Eurocentric status quo in artistic thinking and processes. The photographer collective Through The Lens is a collaborative educational space formed of South African visual artists and educators aimed at furthering the photographic medium as a tool of expression and communication on the African continent. This Joburg-based collective are not alone in their revolutionary thinking; the Cape Town-based curatorial collective Re-Curators is also interested in bucking global conventions through encouraging artistic narratives around Black cultural production in Africa . Further proof that this shifting in representation and presentation of an African sensibility is definitely en vogue , is a group of Johannesburg photographic students currently showcasing works which engage with African tradition, culture and spirituality in an exhibition titled Ihiya: Pieces, Particles, Perpetuity by The Market Photo Workshop . It is showing at the Windybrow Arts Centre and presents works that engage with traditional knowledge systems. All three of these groups of artists concentrate on presenting works which perpetuate an African reality highlighting aspects of our African traditional, spiritual and cultural beliefs, and identities, which might not necessarily align with western norms. South Africans are well-versed with themes of identity in our artistic expressions; this has been an ever-present theme in our art since the Apartheid era where artists presented work reflecting who we as a people were under those conditions. These young groups of artists use art and photography from this era as foundations to build on more focused incarnations of the representation of South African life. A stronger sense of the self is emerging in the works by this new generation. They appear to be ushering African culture, tradition and spirituality into the mainstream. It seems to piggyback on the coolness of their youth, and intersects with cyberspace, where our belief systems manifest in images and narratives on social media platforms. This broadens the African footprint in ways their predecessors – Andrew Tshabungu, Santu Mofokeng, or Ernest Cole - could never have achieved without digital resources. Put simply, the digital global reach of their Afrocentric works is decolonising and inverting the universal qualifiers of what is deemed to be valid knowledge systems – scientific, objective and rational. Simphiwe Majozi, Lapho siphilakhona. Simphiwe Majozi, Untitled. This is evident in works by Simphiwe Majozi, of the Through The Lens Collective , who pays homage to the role ancestors play in our lives. His new body of works is an illustration of the isiZulu custom of Inhlambululo , a ceremony performed after the passing of a relative whereby clothing and heirlooms are passed down to selected family members. This series highlights the belief that ancestors are an ever-present living element in the family and that these belongings act as conduit to the community. Everything about this series from the vernacular titles, to what they depict, all demand that the viewer take note of the artist’s African heritage. Photographs such as Lapho siphilakhona (where we live/gain our wealth), is an image depicting shards of light from a window on a wall, and is meant to represent the metaphysical presence of the ancestors. This conversation is engaged with further in the Ihiya exhibition by Market Photo Workshop students. The work exhibited depicts the process of engagement which students had with African knowledge systems in spaces such as the Faraday Muthi Market and Kwa Mai Mai communities. Examples of how this tangible form of African tradition and spirituality are represented can be seen in images such as Fezeka Mophethe’s Dust which portrays the human form of the spiritual traditions referred to by Majozi. In Mophethe’s photograph of dusty hands holding an unseen ball in darkness we are introduced to a world where human spiritual avatars commune with formless ancestry. Fezeka J Mophete, Dust , 2020. Philadelphia M Makwakwa These are visual narratives which Re-Curators look to expand upon and safeguard in the projects they create and artists they collaborate with. As member Luvuyo Equiano Nyawose explains, “Our collective interest as Re-Curators is to protect and preserve Black cultural production and thought.” We can see this sentiment taking shape in the collective’s most recent curatorial undertaking Past Present Currents at the AVA Gallery in Cape Town. This exhibition concerns itself with expressions of freedom and the opacity of Blackness and sexualities with five artists grappling with Black personhood through photo assemblages and photography, with each of these artists interrogating aspects of themselves as Africans. Vanessa Tembane’s Corpos de agua (Bodies of water ), a water colour and digital print image, exemplifies the dualities of mixed heritage as she depicts elements of her South African and Mozambican lineage by merging family photographs together while simultaneously creating new realities from those memories. Through the creative efforts of artists such as these it would appear that those words from President Nkrumah’s are taking root in ways the revolutionary leader could never have foreseen. – African Art Features Agency funded by the National Arts Council of South Africa.

      <title>Griffin Art Projects presents William Kentridge: The Colander&quot;</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/griffin-art-projects-presents-william-kentridge-the-colander</link>
      <description>William Kentridge: The Colander opens at Griffin Art Projects William Kentridge , Drawings for Projections: City Deep , 2020, Video still, 9 minutes 41 seconds, Courtesy of the Artist The motif of the colander has often appeared in the work of renowned South African artist William Kentridge, eliciting how and when formative state and institutional structures give way, beginning with his examination of post-apartheid South Africa and extending to authoritarian ideologies, regimes and failed states in other parts of the world. Migration, the vulnerability and provisionality of memory and historical account, the absurd and the capricious nature of power and perception in the architecture of socio-political life, are concepts that run throughout Kentridge’s expressive work. Formally, fragmentation and assemblage itself is a conceptual and methodological tool for how the works are made, ordered, shaped and re-ordered in his drawings, films, performances, set design, prints, paintings and sculptures. This exhibition presents the first solo exhibition to be held in Vancouver on the work of this eminent artist and includes key works from the 1990s through to never-before-seen projects produced in 2020-2021. Drawing from private collections in Western Canada as well as a selection of previous works, including the decades long film cycle, Drawings for Projections (1989 – 2020), this exhibition also features new works from the Kentridge Studio, South Africa produced during the global pandemic. William Kentridge: The Colander explores the critique of political structures in Kentridge’s printmaking and filmmaking—looking at the layered, kinetic and collaged nature of his formal working processes, to investigate the porousness and vulnerability of artmaking and life—as well as the processes of the studio in his most recent series, Studio Life . Planned with the research and curatorial assistance of Master Printer Jillian Ross of Jillian Ross Print , and the generous collaboration of Brendan Copestake of Parts &amp; Labour, along with VivianeArt, Calgary and David Krut Workshop in Johannesburg, South Africa, The Colander will be held at Griffin Art Projects from May 29 to September 4, 2021. William Kentridge , Studio Life: Blackboard , 2021, Photogravure on Hahnemühle Natural White 300gsm, Paper size: 44 x 54 cm, Plate size: 28 x 42.3 cm, Courtesy of the artist and Goodman Gallery The exhibition will be accompanied by an extensive public program, titled Worldings , which includes an international and Canadian online virtual conference as well as public programs and residencies, that explore the unique artistic perspectives and histories that exist in Canadian and South African experience as seen through the eyes of artists, writers, curators and activists. The project reflects on the concept of ‘the colander’ and how the global events of 2020-2021 expose, through the experiences that have unfolded in each place, unique histories of precarity, globalization and colonization, to focus on resilience and resistance. This project initially was conceived to consider parallels that exist between Canadian and South African histories of colonization, as well as each country’s eventual Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the reverberations and effects of these colonial political regimes within contemporary 21st century life. This has since unfolded into a program that will focus on the resiliency with which these challenges have been faced through the lens of the events of historical events of the last year, and the ways in which solidarity, resistance and advocacy are remitted in hope, for their capacities to elicit lasting structural change and collective care. Griffin Art Projects is grateful to the Richmond Art Gallery, the Polygon Gallery, Wood Shop Vancouver, Fine Art Framing and the North Vancouver Recreation and Culture Commission for their generous support in the presentation of this exhibition. Griffin Art Projects will now be open Friday to Sunday, 12:00 – 5:00 PM. Bookings are required and can be made on their website . Curated by Lisa Baldissera.</description>

      <title>Remembering When Life Got Still</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/features/remembering-when-life-got-still</link>
      <description>Remembering When Life Got Still Is still life the artwork of these times? Katharien de Villiers, Calling All Gods II (in between everything else i hope someone is praying) , 2020. ENQUIRE . It’s been over a year now since the world was forced indoors. With our movement restricted, our focus was drawn to what existed within our four walls. For those with internet access, escape could be found through our screens but with the frequency of virtual gatherings for work or for play, this quickly lost its novelty. Our immediate surroundings once again drew focus. At least one magazine at the time optimistically suggested rearranging the objects in your home to have something new to look at. Long before the pandemic though, the fashionability of still life was on the rise in photography, thriving on image-sharing applications like Instagram and Pinterest. The need for visually interesting ways to market products on these platforms could be one reason for the commercial popularity of this art form. Still lives featuring luxury goods were reminiscent of Irving Penn’s still lives mixing food and fashion for publications like Vogue in the 1980s; another era where materialism was rife. Another reason still life has reached the mainstream could be related to the acceleration of food-related media, content and publishing seen in the last decade or more; food being a mainstay of still life for centuries. During lockdowns around the world, however, with street photographers kept indoors, and portrait photographers socially isolated, still life, in this medium in particular, exploded. Groceries, recycling and toiletries became subjects as we pondered our new reality. Colbert Mashile, The Stand II , 2018. ENQUIRE . Throughout history images of objects have been used as symbols of mortality or in relation to death. In ancient Egypt, food and belongings were painted onto the inside walls of tombs, believed to become real possessions for the deceased in the afterlife. In Vanitas paintings, a genre of still life painting from the early 17th century Netherlands, objects like skulls, burning candles, clocks, fruit and flowers were used to symbolise death, time passing and nature’s cycles. Perhaps still life’s proliferation over the last year also has to do with the sudden reckoning with our own mortality and the time to muse on our earthly existence and the objects that make up the totems of our lives. Today, still life blurs the line between commercial image-making and art. It doesn’t belong to any singular world or medium; used both to sell a luxury watch and to study a vase of flowers in oils. Contemporary artists continue to use still life as a formal exercise in composition, form and light but also use objects to document or comment on our lives in the 21st century. The photographer Thirza Schaap uses the beauty of still life to confront people with an ugly truth through her attractive arrangements of plastic she’s collected off beaches and coastlines. Others use it to highlight the bizarre and the beautiful found in the mundane. In the 18th century, the theory of the hierarchy of genres ranked still life as having the lowest prestige and cultural capital, trailing behind landscape, history painting or portraiture. Even today, it may not seem important but it’s certainly enduring. We may very well look back and find the humble still life, a shrine to the minutiae of our lives and the mysteries of death, to be a symbol of a year that changed our perspectives. Lee-Ann Heath, Fancy Anthurium . ENQUIRE . Callan Grecia, Vanitas! . ENQUIRE . Karin Miller, still life with mask , 2020. ENQUIRE . Selwyn Steyn, Shrines for Rational Materialists . ENQUIRE .

      <description>LIVE ARTIST INTERVIEWS WITH ANDY MKOSI Portrait credit: Made in Africa Live Latitudes is thrilled to launch a series of live artist interviews. Presented in partnership with Andy Mkosi of This Audio is Visual, the interviews are taking place every Tuesday at 6pm on our Instagram feed . Andiswa ‘Andy’ Mkosi makes music for herself. As a photographer, she uses art to reflect and interpret life as it exists both outside and behind her eyes. Her music is an extension of this reflexive exploration of the world around her, a way of understanding her own lived experience as a black queer woman from the township, and she presents her observations with a startling sincerity. Andy will be interviewing six Latitudes photographers over a six-week period, and these talks will be edited into podcasts for This Audio is Visual. The first talk, which took place on Tuesday 1 September, was with Latitudes artist Tshepiso Moropa. In case you missed it, you can view it here. On Tuesday 8 September, Andy interviewed Wezile Mgibe. Watch the interview here. Tuesday 15 September will see Andy interview Nomvula Millicent Hoko at 6pm, and you can watch the talk on our Instagram Live . Watch this space, as we will update the schedule and add the talks as they take place. Follow us on Instagram to stay tuned.</description>

      <title>COLLECT: A Sculptural Medium</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/collect-a-sculptural-medium</link>
      <description>COLLECT: A SCULPTURAL MEDIUM As an avid or aspiring contemporary art collector, which artistic media are you most drawn to? Painting, photography, printmaking, drawing, film, new media or sculpture? Today, we look at an eclectic selection of three-dimensional artworks by 14 African sculptors, from emerging and mid-career talents to modern masters. While many of these works make use of more traditional materials such as bronze and wood, we also see the artist&apos;s toolbox expanding with the use of concrete, steel, resin, found objects and neon lights. Together, this small selection of works allude to the sheer pleasure that sculptors take in their medium - a medium as challenging in its physicality as it is limitless in scope.

      <title>Esther Mahlangu: Anothher Milestone for South African Painter at 85</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/esther-mahlangu-anothher-milestone-for-south-african-painter-at-85</link>
      <description>ESTHER MAHLANGU: ANOTHER MILESTONE FOR SOUTH AFRICAN PAINTER AT 85 As one of South Africa’s most acclaimed female painters, Esther Mahlangu could be grouped with Agnes Martin, the Canadian, the Iranian, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, Carmen Herrera, the Beirut-born Saloua Raouda Choucair, the Austrian-born potter Lucie Rie and Etel Adnan. Not only has Mahlangu been working in a minimalist abstract mode in the manner of this esteemed group of female artists, but she too has been making art consistently throughout her life and has remained active as an artist in her advanced years. This month the artist will turn 85 and to tie in with the occasion she will be launching the largest solo exhibition she has produced to date online and at the Melrose Gallery’s Johannesburg branch. Dr Esther Mahlangu poses in front of an abode she has adorned with her distinctive interpretation of Ndebele visual traditions. Image by Clint Strydom The landmark exhibition, curated by Ruzy Rusike, is fittingly titled Esther Mahlangu 85, and will showcase a body of artworks created over the last three years including the bold, geometric paintings for which she has received acclaim and an exciting new series of sculptures. Dr Esther Mahlangu continues to paint with a feather brush as per the Ndebele visual traditions. Image by Clint Strydom As with Farmanfarmaian, Mahlangu’s abstraction is inspired by a tradition of geometric painting from her native country. The bold angular forms and flat colours that have defined Mahlangu’s art are rooted in Ndebele visual traditions. Following in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother, she learnt how to paint murals guided by Ndebele traditions from the age of 10. Keen to exploit new possibilities for her art, she transitioned from walls to canvases and then to covering all manner of found objects from war helmets, caravans and motorbikes to mannequins and planes with her characteristic black lines and angular shapes in vivid colours. No two works are the same, though they are all strongly united by a minimalist vocabulary that belies the complexity involved in this pristine distillation of line and colour. How does she maintain such a high level of perfection in her brushstrokes? “In our tradition if a young woman cannot paint a straight line the potential in laws would say that she is not good marriage material. It became something that was essential to master and once mastered it becomes automatic, the straight lines and balance of each painting is non-negotiable and an essential part of Ndebele painting,” says Mahlangu. An untitled abstract work by Dr Esther Mahlangu produced in 2020 Aside from experimenting with the formal characteristics of her art, and continuously striving towards compositional balance, insinuating Ndebele cultural and visual traditions into high art circles and popular culture is what drives Mahlangu. “I want to pass on our tradition from generation to generation. So they can see where Ndebele comes from,” she says. Her immaculate paintings and sculptures, pulsating with bright colours popping against black borders and patterns have been exhibited at the Museum of Arts and Design, New York, The British Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, the National Museum of African Art at The Smithsonian Institution and, of course, famously at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, when she made her debut in Europe in the late eighties. Many experts are of the opinion that no African contemporary art collection can be considered complete without one of Dr Mahlangu’s artworks. As such her works are included in high-profile collections owned by Gervanne and Matthias Leridon, Jean Pigozzi, Isaac Shongwe, Larry Warsh, Swizz Beatz (Dean Collection), Sovereign Art Foundation and Michael Xufu Huang. Her distinctive art has struck a chord with many African-American celebrities - Oprah Winfrey, Alicia Keys, Will Smith and Usher have all acquired pieces by this unassuming South African artist. After years of being overlooked or overshadowed by their male contemporaries, the likes of Farmanfarmaian, Choucair, Rie and Adnan and many other older, established female artists are now enjoying institutional recognition. Mahlangu has won numerous awards. Last year she was bestowed with the Officier de L’Ordre Arts et Lettres (French Order of Arts and Letters) by the French Government. With a touring retrospective of Mahlangu’s vast oeuvre planned for 2023, wide recognition of her art is set to rise further. Yet, the artist is deeply committed to engaging audiences in her native South Africa. “Whilst I have worked with many respected museums, curators, art fairs, galleries and global brands I have had very few solo exhibitions in South Africa. It is exciting for me to be launching one of my largest solos ever at the age of 85 in South Africa so that my own people can experience and enjoy these paintings,” says the artist. An untitled abstract work by Dr Esther Mahlangu produced in 2019 Mahlangu’s global standing, buzz surrounding this new solo exhibition, increased exposure at art fairs, and the upcoming retrospective, have been contributing to the growing value of her artworks. At both the dedicated African Contemporary and Modern sales this year in October, held by Bonhams in London and Piasa in Paris, the works by Mahlangu sold for more than the high estimates set for them. The new sculptures she is producing for the exhibition are an exciting addition for collectors. For the first time she will be painting onto sculptural forms that echo the lines and shapes that have dominated her practice. Clearly, as with many of her female contemporaries, her age isn’t a barrier but an advantage. Esther Mahlangu 85’ can be viewed online from November 11 at https://themelrosegallery.com/viewing-room/6-esther-mahlangu-85/ The exhibition will be open from November 20 at The Melrose Gallery, Melrose Arch, Johannesburg</description>

      <title>Latitudes x TLC announce: The Open Call Collection</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/latitudes-x-tlc-announce-the-open-call-collection</link>
      <description>LATITUDES X TLC ANNOUNCE: THE OPEN CALL COLLECTION Art and artists have always been a critical part of society and culture. Like everyone, they have been deeply affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Many have lost their livelihoods and have little means to survive. Two organisations, The Lockdown Collection (TLC) and Latitudes Online, have gone above and beyond to create exciting opportunities and financial stability for South African artists. In April 2020, TLC curated and auctioned a collection of Covid-19-related artworks by renowned South African artists, with the proceeds going into a fund that would support artists during the pandemic. Featured in The Open Call Collection: Thuli Lubisi, Ethnic Fusion, 2018, Linocut Print, 57.1 × 73.8 cm The auction was so successful that the team extended the project with The Extension Collection and The Student Collection. To date, TLC has paid out over 500 grants – an amount of R1,5 million to date – from its Vulnerable Artists Fund (VAF) to artists across South Africa. It also donated R250 000 to the President’s SA Solidarity Fund, for the benefit of all South Africans in need. Latitudes launched in 2019 as a physical art fair, and when Covid-19 hit, the team acted quickly and decisively, transforming their offering into a year-round online marketplace for art from Africa. Latitudes Online has brought together over 160 sellers of art, creating a powerful platform for which galleries, curators, studios, organisations and, perhaps most importantly of all, during these times, independent artists, can take advantage of Latitudes’ vast global reach to sell their art online. Since its launch in July, the platform has been viewed in 123 of 195 countries, and has shipped works on a daily basis to countries as far afield as the USA, New Zealand, Reunion, Morocco, Italy, France and Hong Kong. In March 2021, the two organisations are coming together to host an online auction created by 21 South African artists. The new collection - called The Open Call Collection - is the result of a beautiful synergy: TLC called for new artwork donations and submissions from South African artists. Latitudes carefully considered each of the hundreds of submissions, before selecting 21 inspiring artworks for the collection. Featured in The Open Call Collection: Vivien Kohler, Second Disciple, 2018, Silkscreen on cartridge paper and spray paint on board, 34cm x 27cm Featured in The Open Call Collection: Puleng Mongale, Cravings of a Lost City Girl II, 2020, Digital Collage, 46 x 46 cm This extraordinary curated collection will be auctioned online, via the Latitudes Online platform, on 21 March, 2021 . The proceeds will be split between the contributing artists, the Lockdown Collection’s Vulnerable Fund, Latitudes Outreach and Artist Proof Studio. It’s no accident that the team has opted to launch the auction on South Africa’s Human Rights Day. This date holds so much significance; it recognises and celebrates the power that people have, for positive change. Artists featured in this new collection include Thuli Libisi, Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Vivien Kohler, Fanie Buys, and Puleng Mongale, to name a few and with the full collection to be released in the coming weeks. “It is a privilege to collaborate with these amazing artists. Their artworks capture the nuances of lockdown life and the effects of the pandemic. Their artistic reflections will become significant historical references for future generations, telling the story of this time,” says Kim Berman, TLC co-founder and Professor of Visual Arts, UJ. Featured in The Open Call Collection: Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Artist Block, 2020, Mixed Media Collage on Paper, 41.6 x 59cm “The Lockdown Collection has demonstrated that art has value that we cannot put a price onto. Art can mobilise a community, it can uplift the vulnerable and it can tell a story that moves us. For Latitudes Online, the partnership with The Lockdown Collection is a welcome opportunity to leverage the strengths of both our organisations,” says Lucy MacGary, co-founder, Latitudes Online. Roberta Coci, co-founder of Latitudes Online, explains that the auction will run online for 21 days. “We’ve seen that there’s great interest in art from southern Africa. We anticipate that our global network of buyers will be very enthusiastic about this collection and we look forward to a very exciting auction”. The TLC Open Call Collection in partnership with Latitudes Online, will launch on 21 March 2021, on the Latitudes Online site (https://latitudes.online/).

      <title>The Sun Rises Daily : Five SA artists using the people’s paper</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/the-sun-rises-daily-five-sa-artists-using-the-people-s-paper</link>
      <description>THE SUN RISES DAILY : FIVE SA ARTISTS USING THE PEOPLE’S PAPER On the sharp edge between horror and humour, the sensational Daily Sun headlines aim to shock in order to sell, its striking graphic red and white logo is unmistakable and its circulation reaches working-class South Africans. Daily Sun has been captivating, enraging and entertaining South Africans for almost two decades with its outrageous headlines jumping out from newsstands or repeated for impact on street pole posters along our daily commute. Launched in 2002, it’s also caught the imagination of South African artists who came of age around the same time the paper came to be the largest daily newspaper in the country. At an affordable price point, the tabloid is widely accessible and in 2014, the paper proved that one copy can be read by up to twenty different people as it’s read and passed on. On the sharp edge between horror and humour, the sensational Daily Sun headlines aim to shock in order to sell, its striking graphic red and white logo is unmistakable and its circulation reaches working-class South Africans. All would be noble aims for contemporary artists in South Africa: to provoke, to sell, to make work that’s recognisable and to relate to a local audience. These five South African artists have used the Daily Sun as a device in their artworks, all in different ways but all to poignant effect. Lady Skollie - 14 Years Sex Drought: An Oath Lady Skollie, 14 Years Sex Drought: An Oath, 2018, Crayon on Fabriano, Size: 43.5 x 32.5 cm. Presented by Everard Read Gallery. ENQUIRE What purpose does the Daily Sun play in your artwork? In South Africa there are so many disgusting headlines; upsetting, disturbing, you can never forget them. I find the humour and often disrespect in Daily Sun headlines as a buffer between me and the somberness of the news. Daily Sun news is HARD and FAST and NOW and I guess I can relate to the method of sugarcoating horror to trick others to engage with it. That is exactly how I see lots of my work, as deeply ugly, upsetting but with a coating of sweet to make it digestible. In your opinion, what meaning does it have in greater South African culture? The poster format of Daily Sun has taught me much, like what a 4-5 is or what a Ben 10 is within a South African context. It brings news to people that do not have access to internet or even much money (R4.20 a copy as opposed to R39 for some of the more bulky &apos;respected&apos; newspapers). I guess I see it as a bridge, my dream is to be on the cover. Charles ‘Steroid’ Mamorobela - Pay Attention Charles Mamorobela, Pay Attention, 2019, Mixed medium on board: 61 cm x 61 cm, Price: R6,500, ENQUIRE What purpose does the Daily Sun play in your artwork? In this artwork I was trying to create that type of awareness that you get when you come across any type of media, newspaper, or news headline. But in this case it was a newspaper so a front-pager article that would show you something that’s affecting us in society. My artwork is based around gender-based violence and violence against children. As you can see, some of the articles that I used in the artwork are real articles that speak about real issues that are happening. All of the things I use in my artworks are relevant to what the artwork is speaking about. In your opinion, what meaning does it have in greater South African culture? I try to make work that impacts the way that the media impacts. I try to make art that speaks to the masses. The reason why I use the Daily Sun newspaper is because Daily Sun is like one of the most common newspapers that anyone can relate to and anyone can identify with from locations to the suburban areas. Everyone knows about Daily Sun with all their controversial newspaper articles. So I wanted to use them to create that kind of controversial artwork because it is a serious issue that I’m addressing in my artwork. Khotso Motseoneng - Daily Sun (why get aid when you can get paid?) Khotso Motsoeneng, Daily Sun (why get aid when you can get paid?), 2018, Acrylic Paint and Collage on Wood. Size: 36,5 x 35,5 cm. ENQUIRE What purpose does the Daily Sun play in your artwork? The purpose of the headline ( Daily Sun ) in my work acts as a reminder to the viewer that the sun rises every day and a new activity arises. In your opinion, what meaning does it have in greater South African culture? In my opinion, the words are received differently depending on which side of the culture you fall on. For the poor people in townships and villages of South Africa it’s a constant reminder of the conditions they have to face each and every new sunrise. Sandile Nzuza - Blinded Sandile Nzuza, Blinded, 2019, Mixed Media on Paper, Signed and dated bottom right. Size: 60 x 45 cm. Price: R5,250. ENQUIRE What purpose does the Daily Sun play in your artwork? My work belongs to the realm of popular culture in that it uses content found in daily newspapers and at times I use branded images of products that are consumed daily. I also use these elements to convey a plethora of social issues that revolve around (Black) masculinity and how it’s visualised in daily media and brands. Therefore, Daily Sun plays a crucial role in my work because it is the carrier of the kind of content that fits within the margins of popular culture, and it’s created in a way that it can draw attention, allows for easy and quick reading and can at times be provocative or spark a little controversy. Traits such as easy readability, thought provocation and noticeability are some of the things I hope to achieve in my work. In your opinion, what meaning does it have in greater South African culture? My assessment of the Daily Sun newspaper is centred around my work’s overarching theme of masculinity and how it’s represented in the newspaper. My assessment often draws parallels between Daily Sun and colonial representations of Africans. These similarities can be seen in how Black men are still associated with animals as was done during the colonial era. This symbolic dehumanisation of Black men is now conveyed in different forms where at times the associations are tied to animism and witchcraft through the invocation of the tokoloshe and his genitals are linked with a 45-caliber pistol. To a general reader, these topics may seem like entertainment or just another article in a newspaper but when read analytically one can conclude that Daily Sun subconsciously maintains certain colonial themes and methods of representing Black men. These themes and methods paint a complex picture of Black South African men, which on the one hand is hegemonic, greedy, fearless and beast-like amongst other things. While on the other hand men are shown as weak, poor and powerless subordinates. These traits ignore the positive good that some (or even most) Black men do in South Africa. Oratile Papi Konopi - Asambe Siyolala, Bua Le Ênê poster series How and why do you use a newspaper headline layout for your works? I began using the tabloid posters because they were the most ideal form for exploring the ideas of &quot;Bua le Ênê&quot;. The object is familiar, fleeting, occupies public space daily and is iconic to the South African city landscape. These posters document, spectacularise and in some cases exist in articulating surreal experiences of everyday people who read these stories. My intention was to borrow what is already associated with the posters and juxtapose it with statements and ideas we would not associate with the poster. I was interested in capturing things which we find difficult to engage with publicly and create more intimate and personal portraits with words. The words that mark us as different or the same, bring us closer yet create distance, with a specific emphasis on articulating complex and multiple ways on being through language.

      <title>Behind the Artwork: Wim Legrand’s ‘we’re Toast!’</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/behind-the-artwork-wim-legrand-s-we-re-toast</link>
      <description>BEHIND THE ARTWORK: WIM LEGRAND’S ‘WE’RE TOAST!’ All of us are in some kind of trouble, and, recently, we’ve all been in the same kind of trouble. We are perhaps not ‘completely ruined’, but there are indications of global anxiety about just a handful of loaded topics that affect us all. Wim Legrand, We&apos;re toast!, 2020. Acrylic on canvas. Signed bottom right. Size: 60 x 80 cm. Price: R 15,000. Presented by 99 Loop Gallery. ENQUIRE. An artwork is generally published with a title, a date, a size and a price. There’ll be some information about what it was made with: crayon, oils, concrete, and if there’s a signature there’ll be directions to find it: front bottom left. But we’re curious to know more. So much of art is left to interpretation but what did the artist intend to say? What value lies in the many sketches and practice rounds they did to reach the final product? And what was happening in the world when they made it? Introducing Behind the Artwork where we zoom in on one artwork and ask the fundamental questions: who, what, when, where and how. First up is Wim Legrand and his piece ‘We’re Toast!’ made when it felt like the world was shutting down. In it a piece of toast acknowledges a universal feeling and adds a pinch of humour to our soupy dread. It was part of his recent solo show, The Parafix, at 99 Loop Gallery. Who? Wim Legrand (Cape Town) was born in Belgium in 1978. After completing his studies in Visual Arts in 2000, he honed his skills as a master printmaker at a prominent international centre for the graphic arts. His career as a painter has steadily advanced in parallel. He combines painting with drawing, cartoons and pop culture with aesthetic references to North European history painting and Surrealist traditions. His work offers a playful take on the paradoxical strangeness of everyday reality, while commenting on our postmodern condition as victims to the barrage of information and news feeds. &quot;I work on the same characters in different media, at the same time. While painting, I was refining drawings in pen and ink, producing a series of prints, and developing the toast as a lapel pin.&quot; What? Let’s talk concept. What is &apos;We&apos;re toast!’ about? The artwork takes its title from the colloquial expression ‘We’re toast’, as in, ‘to be in a lot of trouble or completely ruined’. All of us are in some kind of trouble, and, recently, we’ve all been in the same kind of trouble. We are perhaps not ‘completely ruined’, but there are indications of global anxiety about just a handful of loaded topics that affect us all. The protagonist – an open-mouthed slice of toast covering his eyes with his large cartoon hands – was designed as a symbol, an emoji almost, for a very specific feeling that became familiar to most of us recently. It’s a feeling of fear and anxiety combined with denial, disbelief and a huge desire to rather avoid the reality. It’s a psychology that relates to other works I’ve made in the past, which deal with the idea of ‘victimhood’ in the broadest sense – in that everyone feels, at certain times, as if they are victims of something. This experience ranges (almost obscenely) from being a ‘fashion-victim’ or experiencing FOMO, to being victims in a war zone, of domestic violence, or of the time we live in. The setting of a car boot is a cinematographic reference. Everyone remembers some scene in a movie where a victim is thrown into the boot of the car, left with the hope of escape or discovery by someone who might open the boot later. In my painting, the car boot isn’t closed: the scene is open-ended. There are props such as a lifebelt, a rope, a piece of wood and a spare wheel. The question remains: Will we recognise the props as aids for escape, or will we keep our eyes covered? I use the visual language of cartoons in my work because I feel it is a language that is understood across the world, one that doesn’t need words to express meaning and one that bridges cultures too. When? I made the painting after the first lockdown during the ongoing pandemic. The character came to be sometime during the first weeks of Lockdown Level 5, as a small sketch in a sketchbook. It happened almost accidentally when I was working on some other drawings in preparation for my solo. Where? I have a studio space in Paarden Eiland, an industrial area in Cape Town, where I produced the paintings as well as the drawings and sculptures. It is a small room with access to a multi-purpose workshop. The room is filled with soft sculpture versions I made of the characters, based on drawings and paintings. There are also different objects that inspire me, some older works and always a bunch of things in progress. In the picture, on the left you can see the slice of toast in an early stage. Photograph by Bernard Brand How? I always start from sketches and drawings – notes of ideas, experiences and interpretations of what I perceive daily. The majority of drawings are inspired by everyday objects and the visual language I developed from sampling memories of cartoons from my childhood. Also, most of the time, I draw from the Northern European tradition of landscape painting as a reference or inspiration for my paintings. I especially like the distorted sense of scale in those paintings, which focus on how majestic nature is. In this painting, I used a photographic vintage car reference for the scene. The car boot is the environment and is more of an impression, with very minimal, loose brushstrokes. The inside of the boot is more detailed and is separated from the exterior by a clear outline. It’s all intended to set the right atmosphere and construct a stage for the narrative. I work in acrylic, which forces me to paint fast because of the drying time. Layering is essential in the process – not just practically, but also in the construction of the concept. I am always looking for a balance between an image that evokes a sense of familiarity, something you think you might have seen before, and just the right amount of ‘What the hell am I looking at?’ I work on the same characters in different media, at the same time. While painting, I was refining drawings in pen and ink, producing a series of prints, and developing the toast as a lapel pin. I made a larger-scale soft sculpture to investigate the character’s presence in the real world. The various processes help to mature the ideas. Enquire about ‘We’re toast!’</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/solo-show-puleng-mongale-heaven-on-earth</link>
      <description>SOLO SHOW | PULENG MONGALE | HEAVEN ON EARTH Doyle Wham and Latitudes are delighted to present a solo exhibition of Puleng Mongale (b. 1991, Orlando East, Soweto), surveying key works from the artist&apos;s burgeoning oeuvre. Puleng Mongale, Heaven on Earth, 2021, Fine Art Textured Silk 270GSM, Edition: 10, Size: 42 x 59.4 cm. Presented by Doyle Wham. ENQUIRE Mongale, who currently lives and works in Johannesburg, has developed a unique, referential style of digital collage that combines the familiar and the surreal, the domestic and the universal. Each work is simultaneously a form of innovative self-portraiture, with Mongale artfully inhabiting unexpected characters and situations, from the serene to the provocative. Through this process of self-imagining, the artist both reflects and reconstructs a relationship with her own heritage, particularly absorbing the lineages of the women who surround her. The exhibition’s title, Heaven on Earth, is borrowed from the fourth and most recent work in Mongale&apos;s ongoing Spirit Series. This series further explores and invokes the artist’s connection to a personal and collective past, demonstrating the living reciprocity and significance of such visual manifestations. As is the case throughout Mongale’s artistic practice, these works possess an undeniable, beguiling resonance that invites the viewer to look, and look again. The virtual exhibition has been designed in partnership with New Art City, an artist-run platform that creates a global stage for digital art within innovative, immersive worlds.

      <title>The Open Call Collection Auction</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/the-open-call-collection-auction</link>
      <description>UPCOMING AUCTION | THE OPEN CALL COLLECTION An online auction by Latitudes and The Lockdown Collection As we approach one year of lockdown in South Africa, The Lockdown Collection (TLC) and Latitudes are proud to announce an online auction, created by 21 South African artists, the proceeds of which will go towards benefitting artists affected by the pandemic. THE BACKGROUND In April 2020, TLC curated and auctioned a collection of Covid-19-related artworks by renowned South African artists, with the proceeds going into a fund that supported artists during the lockdown. The auction was so successful that the team extended the project with The Extension Collection and then The Student Collection. To date, TLC has paid out over 500 grants – an amount of R1,5 million – from its Vulnerable Artists Fund (VAF) to artists across South Africa, as well as donated R250 000 to the President’s SA Solidarity Fund, for the benefit of all South Africans in need. Launched in July 2020, Latitudes.Online is a new online marketplace for art from Africa. With over 550 artists and thousands of works represented on the platform, it has become an indispensable resource for collectors and fans of art from Africa to buy and discover new talent from the continent. THE AUCTION Now, the two organisations have come together to host an online auction created by 21 South African artists. The Open Call Collection is the result of a beautiful synergy: TLC called for new artwork donations and submissions from South African artists, and Latitudes carefully considered each of the hundreds of submissions, selecting 21 emerging artists to contribute to the collection. PARTICIPATING ARTISTS Brendon Erasmus Charles &apos;Steroid&apos; Mamorobela Cinthia Sifa Mulanga Colijn Strydom Effo Munguanzo Fanie Buys Givan Lotz Jana+Koos Jo Roets Khanyisile Mawhayi Laura de Harde Nomvula Millicent Hoko Patrick Seruwu Puleng Mongale Sepideh Mehraban Tamara Osso Thalente Khomo Thuli Lubisi Tumisang Khalipha Vivien Kohler Zana Masombuka DISCOVER &amp; CONTRIBUTE This auction provides a rare opportunity for collectors to discover and acquire works by emerging artists, while contributing to a charitable cause. The proceeds will be split between the contributing artists, the Lockdown Collection’s Vulnerable Fund and Latitudes Outreach. The curated collection will be auctioned online from 21-23 March, 2021. It’s no accident that the team has opted to launch the auction on South Africa’s Human Rights Day. This date holds great significance; it recognises and celebrates the power that people have, for positive change. Registration opens Friday 19 March on latitudes.online And if you just can&apos;t wait, email us to place an early bid: info@latitudesartfair.com</description>

      <title>Guest Curator: Luvuyo Equiano Nyawose</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/guest-curator-luvuyo-equiano-nyawose</link>
      <description>Guest Curator: Luvuyo Equiano Nyawose Photography by Andrea Kloppers An artist, curator, filmmaker, researcher and sessional lecturer based in Cape Town, Luvuyo Equiano Nyawose brings thoughtfulness and consideration to everything he does. He also fosters community wherever he goes. This might be a result of his training as a filmmaker and its highly collaborative processes. Since graduating with a BA HONS in film at AFDA, he has been working on his curating chops which began with an Honours Degree in Curatorship from UCT’s Centre for Curating the Archive. After a year interning at the Iziko South African National Gallery in 2019, he now sits as a member of UCT’s Works of Art Committee which is responsible for the curation and acquisitions of the university’s art collection. An artist himself, Luvuyo is currently pursuing his Masters in Fine Arts at Michaelis and is a Creative Knowledge Resources Postgraduate Fellow. His master&apos;s work ‘eBhish’ is an investigation of Black life and Black leisure ebhish’ laseThekwini (commonly known as the Durban beachfront). Luvuyo is also one third of Re-curators Curatorial Collective with Amogelang Maledu and Thembi Matroshe who are working on a group exhibition opening at the AVA in Cape Town next month. We’re excited to have his keen eye glance over the Latitudes artworks to make a selection which means something to him. Yolanda Mazwana , A.M.D II, 2021 Mixed media in canvas.

ENQUIRE . What kind of art are you drawn to personally? At the core, I’m drawn to artwork which is nuanced and traverses rigid didactic depictions and subject matters — artwork which probes, speculates and fabulates. What underlines your curatorial projects? My curatorial approach is rooted in centering Black and queer cultural production and thought. Through the Re-curators Curatorial Collective we seek to collaborate and highlight artists, scholars and writers whose individual nuanced contributions and conceptual merit is rooted in a decolonial praxis — practitioners who make us rethink art production, queer archives and reclaim it from the clutches of the western-heteronormative, patriarchal canon. What do you enjoy about the process of curating? As a young curator, collaboration, community, conversation, experimentation and speculation are key to my curatorial process. Please tell us about your selection from Latitudes: is there a golden thread? The selection consists of artwork which I was personally drawn to. To put it simply the thread is a dynamic conversation through form, abstraction, medium, materiality and composition between established artists and emerging artists.

      <title>Guest Curator: Stephanie Blomkamp of Oath</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/guest-curator-stephanie-blomkamp-of-oath</link>
      <description>Guest Curator: Stephanie Blomkamp of Oath Photography by Anke Loots for Oath Stephanie Blomkamp is the founder and editor of Oath , a print magazine and platform dedicated to championing African photography. Oath’s two greatest missions are to highlight and support emerging talent and to give due attention to overlooked archives from the continent. In working towards these aims, Stephanie’s days are saturated with visuals. “I must see more photographs in one week than most people do in a year,” she says. “Photography is a total joy and my greatest passion.” In the whirlwind weeks leading up to the launch of Oath’s second issue, Stephanie generously spent time on the Latitudes site looking through even more images than her usual dose to hand select a few of her favourites. Here she talks us through her picks. Stephanie: This round of selects I chose because of familiarity and love. I published a few of the photographers in Oath volume one, and my admiration for them grows. My golden thread for all photographs I see is one thing, and one thing only: a reaction. I don’t care what the reaction is — be it happiness, sadness, empathy, disgust — I just need to feel something when I look at a photograph. Prickly ones are great; images that get under the skin or make you think, but sometimes a beautiful shot to me is like a soothing balm. Mpho Mokgadi , Man at the Lake Photographic print on true fibre matt. Edition: 1/7. Size: 66 x 66 cm. Price: ZAR 22,300. Presented by Dyman Gallery . ENQUIRE . I was overjoyed to see one of my favourite portraits by Mpho Mokgadi on Latitudes. I remember first discovering his work on Tumblr and being blown away. He was published as a Go See in Oath volume one. This photograph looks so impressive in print. This image would be my top pick for investing in an emerging talent. Roger Ballen , Mealtime , 2017 Archival print on Hahnemühle photo rag paper. Signed, edition numbered. Edition: 30. Size: 30 x 22,5 cm. Presented by ARTCO . ENQUIRE . Roger Ballen is a photography hero of mine. I think he is brilliant and knowing him personally after working with him for a feature article in Oath, I much admire and respect what he does as an artist, and what he has done for photography on the whole in South Africa. Beyond his photography foundation, his work is an ode to photographers who want to say and do more with photography as an art form; something cerebral and telling beyond a purely documentary approach. I’m continuously inspired by him. John Baloyi , Lilitha 4 35mm Film Photograph on Fabriano Rosapina paper, 280gsm. Edition: /5. Size: 59,4 x 84,1 cm. Price: ZAR 15,000. Presented by Dyman Gallery . ENQUIRE . John Baloyi is a new photographer I discovered last year and I really just love his work. He works in tandem with his partner and together they art direct and shoot some seriously creative photographs. He is an emerging talent but has a remarkably unique visual stamp already. Big fan. Koos Groenewald , Yawn , 2018 Photo Print on Archival paper or Diasec. Edition: 2/5. Price: ZAR 1,950. Presented by Koooooos . ENQUIRE . At times photography should be playful and fun. For this I selected Koos Groenewald’s screaming cat with leopard print. It’s witty and engaging; something I would want in my office space. Perhaps I am so drawn to it because it reminds me of my own reaction to seeing a photograph I get over-excited about. Or a yawn when I am overworked. I don’t know but it definitely has something cool about it. Justice Mukheli , Livhone (Light) , 2019 Photograph. Signed bottom right. Edition: 1/8. Size: 87 x 87 cm. Presented by Dyman Gallery . ENQUIRE . Justice Mukheli is making huge strides in the photography and film world. He’s one of my favourite photographers to follow on Instagram too. His message is always that of LOVE. This translates in his work. I would buy this particular shot in a heartbeat. The symbolism of a young boy with a lantern pioneering his way through brush is like all of us trying to navigate our way in life, and for those of us in the photography industry illuminating a path to inspire younger generations to express themselves. I see a lot of Oath’s mission in this particular image. Look out for Oath Volume Two out soon. Stay updated with Oath on their website and Instagram .</description>

      <description>Guest Curator Roger Sivuyile Lupuwana Roger Sivuyile Lupuwana is the founder and editor of ISYOURS magazine , a platform covering and celebrating independent culture. “I’m constantly surrounded by brilliant musicians, artists, photographers and writers so I wanted to make a contribution to that world and document underrepresented creatives,” he says. Roger is also co-host of Nothing Major on The Other Radio with recording artist and one of his best pals Mx Blouse. He’s also one half of creative production and consulting agency Big and Simple with Binwe Adebayo . This year he was appointed Chief Culture Officer at The Mighty Fine hotel (coming soon). And we haven’t even mentioned his day job in advertising. Each of these roles requires Roger to know the beat of South Africa’s creative pulse by heart. He was an obvious choice as our latest guest curator. We asked him to do some window shopping on Latitudes to choose the artworks he’d most want to take home. Thalente Khomo , Memories of childhood , 2017 Archival print on fine art rag. Price: R3,300. Presented by August House . ENQUIRE . Jozua Gerrard , Woman in White , 2020. Acrylic paint and marker on canvas. Presented by WORLDART . ENQUIRE . Romuald Hazoumé , BB from the series Kpayoland C-type digital print. Presented by October Gallery . ENQUIRE . Rai Gandra , RILF - Revolutionaries I&apos;d like to fuck , 2016 C print from digital file. R 2,500. ENQUIRE . Kim Makin , Other (a series) I , 2017 Archival Giclée Print on Hahnemühle Photo Rag. Price: R 5,200. Presented by Re-Curators . ENQUIRE . What kind of art are you drawn to personally? When it comes to visual art I’d say I find myself almost obsessed with what others would call “trashy Instagram art”, but whatever. Digital art or any other new media allows for a constant flow of emerging artists, new ideas and techniques that were often not considered before. There’s much more access to so many people in an art world that can be quite exclusionary and elitist. And I’m not just talking vaporwave posters and glitch art. What I’m drawn to ranges from point-and-shoot archives from underground queer rave to collage art with Grindr memes, boys kissing boys, cityscapes and vulgar graffiti, dick drawings and Disney princesses, Teletubby bad bads, 3D art meets pop culture. It’s a fabulous juxtaposition of ideas and worlds where anything goes and I love it. Has your taste changed over the years? My taste changes all the time, because my mind changes all the time. At first, I was always drawn to posters or illustrated prints with crazy characters, bright colours or cheeky texts. I still mostly own illustrations but the more I take things less seriously the more I want to collect more mixed-media and photographic pieces. Do you have a favourite artwork, poster or photograph in your home? I bought a print from Hannah Shone called “I Don’t Get Bananas Really” (2017) from her second solo exhibition “Fantasma” at No End Gallery. I hate bananas, and it’s a great reminder of our friendship and how we truly get each other. I also have this one Daniel Ting Chong piece that was a birthday gift from my friend Angie Batis Durant a while back. It’s this snake that hangs boldly over our living room. It’s quite trippy if you’ve had a wine or two, but it’s the best. Please tell us about your selection from Latitudes: is there a theme? Not really. I don’t think there is a need to be super profound about art. That’s when I find you can truly get to enjoy it, laugh about it and feel free whether you’re the artist, curator, or collector. It’s just a collection of what I would want in my home, how I think my personality would come out and a mix of artists I love. I thought a diverse mix of established and POC artists is also important. My partner (who is also an artist) knows my taste well and helped me narrow it down to the final five.

      <title>Remembering When Life Got Still</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/remembering-when-life-got-still</link>
      <description>Remembering When Life Got Still Is still life the artwork of these times? Katharien de Villiers, Calling All Gods II (in between everything else i hope someone is praying) , 2020. ENQUIRE . It’s been over a year now since the world was forced indoors. With our movement restricted, our focus was drawn to what existed within our four walls. For those with internet access, escape could be found through our screens but with the frequency of virtual gatherings for work or for play, this quickly lost its novelty. Our immediate surroundings once again drew focus. At least one magazine at the time optimistically suggested rearranging the objects in your home to have something new to look at. Long before the pandemic though, the fashionability of still life was on the rise in photography, thriving on image-sharing applications like Instagram and Pinterest. The need for visually interesting ways to market products on these platforms could be one reason for the commercial popularity of this art form. Still lives featuring luxury goods were reminiscent of Irving Penn’s still lives mixing food and fashion for publications like Vogue in the 1980s; another era where materialism was rife. Another reason still life has reached the mainstream could be related to the acceleration of food-related media, content and publishing seen in the last decade or more; food being a mainstay of still life for centuries. During lockdowns around the world, however, with street photographers kept indoors, and portrait photographers socially isolated, still life, in this medium in particular, exploded. Groceries, recycling and toiletries became subjects as we pondered our new reality. Colbert Mashile, The Stand II , 2018. ENQUIRE . Throughout history images of objects have been used as symbols of mortality or in relation to death. In ancient Egypt, food and belongings were painted onto the inside walls of tombs, believed to become real possessions for the deceased in the afterlife. In Vanitas paintings, a genre of still life painting from the early 17th century Netherlands, objects like skulls, burning candles, clocks, fruit and flowers were used to symbolise death, time passing and nature’s cycles. Perhaps still life’s proliferation over the last year also has to do with the sudden reckoning with our own mortality and the time to muse on our earthly existence and the objects that make up the totems of our lives. Today, still life blurs the line between commercial image-making and art. It doesn’t belong to any singular world or medium; used both to sell a luxury watch and to study a vase of flowers in oils. Contemporary artists continue to use still life as a formal exercise in composition, form and light but also use objects to document or comment on our lives in the 21st century. The photographer Thirza Schaap uses the beauty of still life to confront people with an ugly truth through her attractive arrangements of plastic she’s collected off beaches and coastlines. Others use it to highlight the bizarre and the beautiful found in the mundane. In the 18th century, the theory of the hierarchy of genres ranked still life as having the lowest prestige and cultural capital, trailing behind landscape, history painting or portraiture. Even today, it may not seem important but it’s certainly enduring. We may very well look back and find the humble still life, a shrine to the minutiae of our lives and the mysteries of death, to be a symbol of a year that changed our perspectives. Lee-Ann Heath, Fancy Anthurium . ENQUIRE . Callan Grecia, Vanitas! . ENQUIRE . Karin Miller, still life with mask , 2020. ENQUIRE . Selwyn Steyn, Shrines for Rational Materialists . ENQUIRE .

      <title>Latitudes co-curates Artnet&apos;s Africa Present auction</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/latitudes-co-curates-artnets-africa-present-auction</link>
      <description>Latitudes collaborates with Artnet and Africa First to promote new artistic voices from Africa African art takes to the world stage once again, at the Africa Present auction Latitudes will be co-curating the &quot;Meet&quot; Section within Artnet Auctions’ second Africa Present sale, an auction designed to highlight the work of up-and-coming as well as established artists from the African continent. Artnet is a leading resource for buying, selling, and researching art online. Founded in 1989, the online platform has revolutionised the way people discover and collect art today. “Latitudes is thrilled to be able to partner with a giant of the industry, in order to both broaden the collector base for art from Africa and set values for contemporary, living artists on the auction market,” says Lucy MacGarry, co-founder of Latitudes Online. The Africa Present auction, a partnership between Artnet and Africa First by Serge Tiroche, is a dynamic initiative that uses the reach, contacts, and capabilities of Artnet’s global art marketplace to raise awareness about contemporary artists from Africa. In a forward-thinking bid to feature artists across all career stages, the auction lots are categorised into three sections: Meet, Support and Invest. Turiya Magadlela, Imibala, Pantyhose with Acrylic sealer on canvas, 100cmx 100cm Latitudes Online, which was founded during the 2020 lockdown, has made a name for itself, not only as a platform that promotes and sells art from the African continent, but also as an organisation that focuses on identifying and supporting new talent. It was therefore a natural fit for the two parties to come together, and for Latitudes to co-curate the Meet section of the upcoming sale, in which new talent is showcased. “Currently, there is an explosion of fresh talent on the continent, and we’re delighted to be able to introduce these new voices to the huge global audience that Artnet has built over the past 32 years,” says Roberta Coci, co-founder of Latitudes Online.

      <title>Explore Innovative Works by Four Daring Zimbabwean Artists on Artnet Auctions</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/explore-innovative-works-by-four-daring-zimbabwean-artists-on-artnet-auctions</link>
      <description>Explore Innovative Works by Four Daring Zimbabwean Artists on Artnet Auctions Fadzai Muchemwa, curator of the 2022 Zimbabwe Pavilion at the Venice Biennale writes about four up and coming Zimbabwean artists featured in Africa Present on Artnet Auction. At the upcoming 59th Venice Biennale in 2022, Zimbabwe will be represented by four exceptional artists whose innovative works interrogate the ambiguities between reality and fantasy. These four artists—Ronald Muchatuta, Wallen Mapondera, Kresiah Mukwazhi, and Terrence Musekiwa— create evocative works that are politically charged, pushing back against the use of brute force and grabs of power plaguing their nation. Right now, works by all four artists are being offered now in the “ MEET ” section of Africa Present , live now on Artnet Auctions , and co-curated by Latitudes , a new online marketplace for contemporary art from Africa. Created in partnership with Serge Tiroche, this sale is live now through September 14. The below five works move beyond the usual discourse of Zimbabwe, depicting the country as a space of encounters, resilience, and small acts of care, against the spectacle of human suffering. They attend to both the spectacular and the mundane experiences in the face of catastrophe and polarisation. The convergence of this group of artists goes beyond protest art’s rigid, often formulaic confines. Ronald Muchatuta - Her Bliss (2020) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $7,000–9,000. Her Bliss by Ronald Muchatuta is self-reflexive, satirical, and deliberately digressive. Inspired by the character Anta in Djibril Diop Mambéty’s 1973 film Touki Bouki , this work explores issues of migration and hardship. Her Bliss contains various visual elements that nod to Mambéty’s seminal work, including the pool, the goat, the charged energy, and, of course, Anta. The warm, summery colours represent the attractive life that one envisions when coming from a place of darkness, a reminder of the social, political, cultural, and geographic contention that one associates with Zimbabwe. Yet, there are other layers to the messaging of the work. The reference to Touki Bouki is a tongue-in-cheek exploration of issues of seeing, desire and representation. Bouki is a clever and cunning Wolof and a popular character who causes mischief and cheats his way to what he wants. Much like the character Tsuro (the hare) in Shona folklore, the reference to Bouki speaks of the use of metaphor and imagery to hide in plain sight. Wallen Mapondera - Kubvunura III (2017) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Est. $9,000-12,000. Kubvunura III , the title of Wallen Mapondera’s work, is a word with a lexical ambiguity that talks of unbundling, unraveling, and uncovering. “Kubvunura” is also a play on “Kubvondora,” a colloquial Shona word that means whistleblowing, an apt description of Mapondera’s practice of socio-political commentary. The distinctive materials that Mapondera uses in this work, the pieces of cardboard and the sewing thread, speak directly to his practice and draw from the lives of the ordinary man at the mercy of unscrupulous politicians and forces of capital. Mapondera looks to cardboard packaging as a tool for survival and exploration. Kresiah Mukwazhi - Unreachable Parts Painted Gold (2018) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $7,000–9,000. Kresiah Mukwazhi’s Unreachable Parts Painted Gold is a celebration of women who survive, at all costs, in a world of precarity. Her work delves into the underbelly of the sex work industry, chastising a society that continues to push sex workers into the shadows. Unreachable Parts necessitates and provokes active spectatorship and conversations about governing where the body is the territory being governed. Mukwazhi represents or poses a threat to social order through her textile work. She complicates the dichotomy between what is seen and what is said. Bold choices and socio-political themes place marginalised protagonists in the centre of her works, seeking to realise an elusive dream. Terrence Musekiwa - Kubuda Mudope 7 (2021) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $5,000–7,000. Terrence Musekiwa’s Kubuda Mudope 7 directly translates to Out of the mud. The word “dope” (mud) is an allusion to the predicaments and exigent circumstances that one must escape. Musekiwa utilises scraps in his practice, fusing stone sculptures with other scrap materials, as a commentary on the fear and survival tactics that many utilise to adapt and to survive. Terrence Musekiwa - Muimbi (Singer) 2020 Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $3,000–5,000. Much like Kubuda Mudope 7 , Musekiwa’s piece Muimbi (Singer) is created from his signature technique of combining hand-carved stone with found and industrial objects. The artist’s visual language wrestles with convention to simultaneously challenge and pay homage to Zimbabwean tradition, creating a dialogue about the mechanics, politics, and the micro and macro trade systems of his home country.

      <title>Collector Mark Ramirez On Art That Gives Him A Physical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/collector-mark-ramirez-on-art-that-gives-him-a-physical-reaction</link>
      <description>Collector Mark Ramirez On Art That Gives Him A Physical Reaction &quot;In part, Latitudes is responsible for my art compulsion.&quot; Souad Abdel Rassoul, Venus Rebirths , 2021. R 295,000.00 ex. VAT. Presented by Eclectica Contemporary. ENQUIRE . In the midst of the pandemic, deep into 2020, Mark Ramirez began collecting art. &quot;The art I collect inspires me and provides me with comfort in these uncertain times,&quot; he says. Originally from Belize in Central America, Mark now lives in the high desert of New Mexico in the States. It&apos;s here that he&apos;s worked as an educator in the public school system for the past decade, and studies toward a Master&apos;s degree in organisational development with the goal of driving change within school administration. Mark has always been fascinated with art and the lives of artists. His growing collection includes work by emerging contemporary African artists (a few he&apos;s bought from Latitudes) Cinthia Sifa Mulanga , Jozua Gerard , Tamara Osso , Callan Grecia , Matty Monethi , and Phumulani Ntuli . &quot;The works I collect are diverse like my experiences and my gustos (likes),&quot; he says. Collecting art has inspired his creative side, and amidst the work of artists he&apos;s inspired by, are his own canvases and paintings. &quot;I find creating art liberating and exciting.&quot; We took the opportunity to ask about his collection and how he knows when a piece is the one. What was the first piece of art you ever bought? The first piece I ever bought was a large figurative painting of a skull from a young local Native American artist Jessie Littlebird. I followed the artist on Instagram and immediately was attracted to his almost brutalist figures painted in thick rich vibrant hues. His figures seem to be suspended in action. The artist posted the artwork for sale on IG and I reached out and inquired about piece. After contemplating it for a few days (and finding the perfect wall for the piece) I reached out to him and confirmed my interest. It was larger than I pictured and I was almost not able to fit it into my car. That was the beginning. How does collecting art enrich your life? The answer to this question has many layers and I hope I can articulate it well. All art is beautiful to me. There are certain pieces that speak louder than others to me. There has been artwork that causes a physical reaction in me, a feeling that starts in my stomach and then causes my heart to race. Then a yearning to have the work near me, to care for it, to appreciate it, and to learn from it. Oftentimes when I acquire work I have no idea where it will hang, I just know that I need it near me. Every time I walk past an artwork I find something new to love about it, be it colour, texture, shape, or light. Ayanfe Olarinde and Jamilla Okubo in the collector&apos;s home. Phumulani Ntuli, Camouflage I , 2021. Acquired via Latitudes. How would you describe your collection? My collection is contemporary, fresh, and unexpected. I mostly collect young artists’ work. Do you have any rules or tips for collecting art? Collect what you like and what brings you joy. If a piece of art causes a physical reaction when you see it there’s a reason it did. If you think about it or dream about it, it is meant to be with you. What interests or excites you about art from Africa? In 2018 there was a traveling show titled “Making Africa” of curated art pieces from the African diaspora. The exhibition was at the Albuquerque Museum and included works from over 120 artists including Cyrus Kabiru, Cheich Diallo, and Gonçalo Mabunda to name a few. The show included works in mixed media – scrap material reimagined into amazing pieces of art. This started my curiosity and deep appreciation for art from Africa. What do you enjoy about Latitudes? I first learned about Latitudes by following the work of Cinthia Mulanga on her IG account. She posted a Latitudes announcement on July 15th, 2020 sharing that Latitudes was now an online marketplace. Of course, I immediately visited the site and then discovered the artworks page! I instantly started searching for artists whose work I had seen at the museum exhibit before and discovered so much new art. In part, Latitudes is responsible for my art compulsion. I enjoy that Latitudes constantly showcases new works on their site and that they share artist interviews and features to introduce new artists to the world. The Latitudes team has also been very instrumental in helping me acquire pieces by arranging payment and shipping and always with the utmost professional and friendly service. Is there an artist who has your attention at this moment? There are always artists who have my attention. I am a fan of Cinthia Mulanga’s work as well as Jozua Gerard. One artist’s work that I find captivating is the work of Souad Abdel Rassoul . Her work is hauntingly beautiful. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Envious . Acquired via Latitudes. Tamara Osso, Sisters . Acquired via Latitudes. Matty Monethi, It&apos;s been 5 months . Acquired via Latitudes.</description>

      <title>&apos;ARE THERE ANY LEFT?’</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/are-there-any-left</link>
      <description>&apos;Are There Any Left?’: A Sales Frenzy at London’s 1-54 Fair Reflects the Heated Demand for African Contemporary Art The fair features 48 galleries showing work by more than 150 African and diaspora artists. Written by Amah-Rose Abrams , October 14, 2021 Installation view of the 1-54 Art Fair 2021 In 2020 1-54, the contemporary African art fair, was the only physical fair to take place in London—even then, it was reduced to a hybrid event with only 20 physical exhibitors, about half of its usual footprint. Against a backdrop of a rising international profile for art and artists working across the continent, the fair’s ninth U.K. edition opened today at Somerset House to a changed landscape on many fronts. At the preview for press and VIPs, visitors came hungry for information on artists they did not yet know and eager to buy work by those that they did. As the day progressed, fairgoers stayed on, sunning themselves on and around the courtyard commission by the London-based artist Lakwena Maciver. Little did they know that half of the sculptures—from the series I’ll Bring You Flowers , 2021—had already been sold, for £20,000 ($27,400) each by Vigo Gallery. As the afternoon progressed and the aisles became packed, Dutch gallery Nuweland—a first-time participant—sold out of sculpture by recent art-school graduate Ben Orkin, with one collector running in, shouting, ‘Are there any left?’ before snapping up the last one available. Installation view of Lakwena Maciver’s courtyard commission at Somerset House, Courtesy of 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair “It’s a very different landscape this time. Last year we were looking into the unknown,” the fair’s founder and director, Touria El Glaoui, told Artnet News. This year’s event welcomes 34 returning galleries and 14 new exhibitors representing 150 African and diaspora artists from 23 countries, including Angola, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, as well as Brazil, the Netherlands, Italy, the United States, Switzerland, Belgium, and the U.K. In a noticeable shift, the past years’ focus on figuration is giving way to more abstract works and those employing yarn and fabric—as well as ceramics, in keeping with a trend across the London fairs. The talked-about standouts include Eddy Kamuanga Ilunga at October Gallery, Nabil El Makhloufi’s dark and beautiful paintings at Nil Gallery, and paintings by Zanele Muholi—mostly known for her photography and film—who had her first survey at Tate Modern in 2020, shown by Galerie Carole Kvasnevski of Paris. Installation view of the 1-54 Art Fair 2021, Courtesy of 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair Sales came hot and fast across the fair. Ed Cross Fine Art, of London, sold out its booth dedicated to the work of local artist Sahara Longe, who combines technical skill with a touch of satire in paintings that remix classical portraiture with contemporary Black figuration. Three works went to a U.K. collection, at prices ranging from £8,000 to £20,000 ($11,000–$27,400), and After Party , 2021, sold to a museum in Asia for £16,500 ($22,600). Mayfair’s Richard Saltoun, joining the fair for the first time, sold a work by South Africa’s Berni Searle for £24,000 ($32,900) and seven paintings by the artist, writer, and curator Everlyn Nicodemus, all in the £15,000-to-£30,000 ($20,600–$41,000) range. Collectors also flocked to two Parisian comers: Galerie Eric Dupont, which sold four of Roméo Mivekannin’s striking portraits on fabric in two hours, for prices between £5,000 and £20,000 ($6,800–$27,300), and Galerie Dominique Fiat, which sold three photographs by Malala Andrialavidrazana to private foundations for between £13,000 and £16,000 ($17,800–$21,900). Accra’s kingmaker—Gallery 1957, which represents Ghanian breakout star Amoako Boafo—reported sales of “many works” between £3,500 and £20,000 ($4,800–$27,400) at its booth, which features works by Serge Attukwei Clottey, Godfried Donkor, and Arthur Timothy. From the Ethiopian capital, Addis Fine Art placed all of its works on paper by recent Saatchi Yates star Tesfaye Urgessa for £10,000 ($13,687) apiece, while DADA Gallery, of Lagos, sold three fabric works by Bunmi Agusto priced at £8,000 ($10,949) each. Even smaller outlets with less well-known names who had yet to close a sale were optimistic and upbeat heading into the weekend. Nabil El Makhloufi, Night Veil (2021), Courtesy of the artist and Nil Gallery, Paris Notably, these deals were made within the first few hours of the preview, perhaps reflecting an altered schedule (a day later, rather than coinciding with, Frieze’s vernissage) or the global socio-political shift of the past 18 months. Certainly, interest in contemporary African art has soared; in the past year, Amoako Boafo has collaborated with Kim Jones of Dior, and other artists have been picked up by blue-chip galleries; for example, Otis Kwame Kye Quaicoe joining Almine Rech. “I think there’s definitely been a moment after the Black Lives Matter movement, and we’re still seeing the benefit of people’s attention and awareness of artists coming from Africa, the African diaspora,” Galoui said. “We have also seen this week this engagement with artists from Africa or the diaspora, with a lot of the main London galleries showcasing some unbelievable work.” Eddy Kamuanga Ilunga, Untitled (2021), Courtesy of the artist and October Gallery, London However, even after eight years and the launch of companion fairs in New York and Marrakesh, El Glaoui was reluctant to take full credit for bringing the world’s attention to the continent’s rich and varied creative output. “I’m hoping that it’s a constant evolution,” she says. “I’m hoping that we are going to see this engagement and integration continue in the long term. But we know that the art world is very trendy—they love new things, and they love being in the right moment at the right time—so I hope that at least 1-54 will be able to be that place in the platform. We are having an amazing moment.” 1-54 runs through Sunday, October 17, at Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R. This article was originally published on Artnet .</description>

Since its debut in 2016, ART X Lagos has become known for its ambitious program, which includes ART X Talks - a lively panel discussion series curated by Aude Mgba ; ART X Live! - a one-of-a-kind showcase featuring collaborations between some of the fastest-rising artists and musicians on the African continent, curated by Lanre Masha, Faridah Folawiyo and Ayo Lawson ; as well as specially curated presentations and interactive projects.

Each project reflects on the current challenges experienced in Africa, including the aftermaths of colonisation and slavery, along with the consequences of political regimes that contribute to inequality and sociopolitical exclusion. The projects take inspiration from archives in the past and experiences in the present to imagine diverse possibilities for the future of Africa. We Are Here is this year&apos;s Interactive Project . Curated by A Whitespace Creative Agency, We Are Here bringstogether two artist collectives in film and music - the Kaduna-based film collective The Critics and the Lagos-based sound collective The Village Sound System - and teams them up with ART X Lagos’s daily visitors to produce a dynamic short film.

Their second issue, &apos;Bloom&apos; , launched this spring and offers a rare glimpse into the homes of artists, creatives and collectors where we personally enjoyed spying the art on their walls. In return, we invited LOOKBOOK Studio to lend their sharpened gaze to Latitudes to pick out pieces that inspire them right now, and would slip seamlessly into the interiors inside &apos;Bloom&apos;.

[laughs] LOOKBOOK Studio is a content creation studio and independent media company, which we launched in 2020.

      <title>Aspire Art Auctions | Modern</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/aspire-art-auctions-modern</link>
      <description>Best Beyond The Ages November Modern and Contemporary Live Auction --------------------------------------- To end the year on a high note, Aspire Art Auctions will present an exciting sale of Modern and Contemporary Art this November in Johannesburg. Set to be held at the company’s exquisite new home in the heart of the Rosebank art district, the sale will offer collectors a fresh and carefully curated selection of landmark artworks coveted both for their rarity and artistic excellence. This sale aims to follow on the historic success of the October auction. The brilliantly varied sale offers rarely seen lots of artworks from the earliest edge of modern art history, featuring delicately crafted prints from as early as 1804 by English naturalist and colonial era documentarian Samuel Daniell , along with the recent marvels of contemporary fractal and amoeba-like watercolour explorations of Marcus Neustetter. Highlights of this summer sale include lots lifted from Irma Stern&apos;s golden period. They are a gloriously yellow Still Life with roses, blue bowl and the artist’s brushes in a pot. Estimated at R3.5-4 million, the marvellous painting embodies all the pedigree that has earned Stern renown as South Africa’s most valuable painter. The masterfully painted work is fittingly balanced by the vitality and graceful dexterity of the drawing titled, Woman with Headscarf executed in 1941 while she was traveling through the Eastern Cape. Irma Stern, Still life with roses, blue bowl and the artist&apos;s brushes in a pot, 1936, Oil on canvas George Pemba is a modern master who the market is finally catching up on. Thanks to a stunning exhibition at Cape Town&apos;s Norval Foundation nudging art lovers to take note of his greatness, Pemba’s work has been seeing great success and high demand. Included in the auction is a very rare set of watercolours by Pemba. The lots provide a fantastic insight into his facility as a painter gifted beyond the confirmed medium of oil. Another sure-bet painter, Vladimir Tretchikoff , is represented in this auction with a large oil equestrian study titled Race Horses . Celebrated as the people’s painter, Tretchikoff had found a unique and populist take on art history’s seminal motifs with a knack that earned him the “king of kitsch” moniker. He started painting horse races in the late 1960s and continued with the theme during the 1970s while attending many of the events at Kenilworth racecourse in Cape Town. Those visits inspired Race Horses, depicting competition horses on a calm walk and not in a grand gallop. Alfred Thoba, Fruits of Life , 1990, Oil on board These marvels of modern painting are offered alongside iconic sculptural works, including exceptional and monumental works by Edoardo Villa. Among them is a large dynamic piece produced in 1991 as South Africa was going through the birth pains of a new democratic order. The work is appropriately titled African Throne. Its majestic air finds colourful rhyme with other Villas on the sale – a pair of blazing red and blue painted twin steel works, Interlocking forms (Sylvan) red and blue from1992 . Physically dwarfing all these is a colossal piece from the momentous year of 1976, Three Personages. It can be read as a dark shining modernist monument to another important image that came out of the troubled year – the now famous three figures in the photographic Pietà of Hector Peterson. Along with the colourful iron certainty of Villa, bidders have a chance to catch a much-coveted contemporary constructivist piece by Wim Botha. The work is one of the best examples of why Botha is celebrated for his unparalleled balance of probing philosophical perspective and impeccable artistic technical skill. The attractively priced sculpture comes to market on the back of a ground-breaking exhibition at the Norval Foundation celebrating the artist and placing savvy collectors on notice. Edoardo Villa, Three Personages, 1976, P ainted steel The auction also features a great selection of contemporary works. Among these are the prodigiously gifted colourist Kate Gottgens . Her generation’s answer to tested painterly voices like Stern and Robert Hodgins, Gottgens’ large painting, The Abstractor arrives in the sale fresh from a show at Sydney Contemporary in Australia. Its blazing brilliance finds virtuosic companionship offered alongside a grandiose best of class Asha Zero acrylic on board. Zero’s work is poised to stimulate a growing interest in his unique artistic voice among a new generation of collectors and tastemakers. Collectors have a chance to bid for the largest Simon Stone painting to ever come to the auction. The History of Bush Fires , “perfectly plays up the contrasts between representation and abstraction,” shining light on why William Kentridge refers to Stone as South Africa’s best painter. In contemporary drawing, vitality and virtuosity have no better host than the hands of Phillemon Hlungwani. His magnificent work, You Create Your Own Happiness is a fitting elixir as we begin to shake off the despair of the past two years of covid pandemic. The work is sure to set a new record for the artist. Beezy Bailey, Water on Fire , 2011, Oil and enamel on canvas A further highlight is a series of drawings by Diane Victor. Among the three works on offer is a large-scale piece, There’s Fire in the Thatch , unique in her oeuvre. It&apos;s a rare example of a period when she was using a lot of colour in her work compared to her better known monochromatic prints. Other major drawings include dreamy mythological works by Deborah Bell. They sit well alongside notable drawings by Dumile Feni to complete a compelling art historical picture. Collectors interested in the story of Feni embrace his influence on William Kentridge . There is a great variety of work showcasing the diverse range of his iconic style and artistic voice. Examples are a large poster from Resist the Hour alongside etchings from his Domestic Scenes -Preparations for Hat day and Triumph of Bacchus a monumental work of twenty etchings, each printed on 100% Hemp Phumani handmade paper and mounted on raw cotton cloth. A notable highlight of the auction is a selection of lots from the collection of the multi-award winning production house, Handspring Puppet Company . Founded in 1981, the company grew under the leadership of Artistic Director Adrian Kohler and Executive Producer Basil Jones for over 40 years. They’ve presented work in over 30 countries across the world and are widely recognised as South Africa’s pre-eminent puppet company. Aspire presents a unique selection of 26 works, presented in 15 lots, from their collection. The works have been collected over more than 3 decades and map much of the company’s creative, personal and professional journey. Including works by celebrated artists such as William Kentridge, George Pemba, Simon Stone and Zanele Muholi, amongst others, the collection offers buyers a unique opportunity to possess a rich piece of history in acquiring work selected by and reflective of the outstanding taste of Handspring’s world-renowned creatives. Don’t miss the wonderful ceramics section on offer too. The selection is spread across the grand variety and kaleidoscope of traditions in South Africa. It includes renowned potters such as Lucinda Mudge, Robert Hodgins, Noria Mabasa, Josephine Ghesa and Petros Gumbi. The incredible collection of photography includes works by some of the country&apos;s great contemporary artists including; Z anele Muholi, Billy Monk, Bonile Bam, Jac de Villiers, along with Mikhael Subotzky and Patrick Waterhouse. William Kentridge, Triumph of Bacchus , 2016, Twenty lift ground aquatint etchings printed on 100% Hemp Phumani handmade paper, each etching mounted on raw cotton cloth folded (as a map) and housed in a handmade box covered in raw cotton cloth Aspire Art Auctions New Offices and Gallery in Johannesburg The November auction will see Aspire Art Auctions welcoming art lovers and bidders to their new office and gallery in Johannesburg.

      <title>Invictus Capital&apos;s NFT Lab Launches the First NFT Collection of African Art</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/invictus-capitals-nft-lab-launches-the-first-nft-collection-of-african-art</link>
      <description>Invictus Capital&apos;s NFT Lab Launches the First NFT Collection of African Art A pioneer in the digital asset space, Invictus Capital has unveiled its first NFT (non-fungible token) collection through the Invictus NFT Lab which combines African fine art with blockchain technology. “The global pandemic has been especially challenging for creatives worldwide, with fine artists particularly hard hit by gallery closures, curtailed travel and canceled exhibitions,” says Brett Bellairs from 131 A Gallery. In the face of these challenges, many digital artists have embraced the opportunity to engage with the fast-growing community of NFT collectors. But artists who make physical works have been left behind. At the same time, traditional art collectors have struggled to see the value proposition of ownership rights to a publicly-accessible digital file. The Out of Africa Collection by the Invictus NFT Lab bridges this gap in that it&apos;s an NFT collection that includes curated artworks in physical form from a range of professional fine artists at the top of their game. Collectors will bid on NFT representations of the original, physical artworks. These NFTs act like a certificate of ownership that allows the holder to have the physical artwork delivered to them, if they wish. The NFT representations will often incorporate animation, or other augmented reality features made possible by digitization. The collection is made up of 100 curated, unique NFTs by top Southern African artists backed by (and redeemable for) physical artworks across a range of mediums. The project is a first foray into the NFT space for most of the participating artists and will introduce their work to a global crypto market. “This inaugural collection is a first of its kind for Southern African artists, and global investors,” says Daniel Schwartzkopff, CEO at Invictus Capital. The strength of Southern Africa&apos;s diversity in culture and artistic style shines throughout the collection; from Robert Slingsby’s use of ancient geometry to celebrate African heritage to Blessing Ngobeni’s brave sociopolitical commentary to Olivié Keck’s pop culture-inspired whimsy. &quot;This collection is a triumph for these artists and represents some of the finest new, upcoming and established talent,” says Marelize van Zyl, Curator for the Out of Africa NFT collection. For collectors, NFTs make it possible to cut out significant middleman costs that can make investing in art otherwise unpalatable. “For artists, NFTs give them access to a truly global audience and a royalty-driven revenue model made possible by blockchain,” says Charl Bezuidenhout of WorldART. The project kicks off in January, with the distribution of NFT posters to interested parties, and will culminate in an auction in February for NFT representations of the original artworks. The auctions will be facilitated by the OpenSea NFT market, the world’s largest and most trusted NFT resale platform. The Invictus NFT Lab is an example of Invictus Capital&apos;s imperative to disrupt traditional investment and financial services. &quot;We believe that an NFT Lab, like this one, will go a long way to bringing NFTs into mainstream investment portfolios, and appeal to traditional art collectors; modern NFT collectors and anyone in between”, says Schwartzkopff.

      <title>Crafting a ‘museum’ worthy African art collection</title>

      <description>Crafting a &apos;museum&apos; worthy African art collection Mary Corrigall takes a close look at the collecting patterns of three renowned public museums to discover which African artists enjoy institutional validation in New York, London and Paris. Do public museums carry as much power, since private art museums started driving exhibition programming and snagging the most sought-after works? Installation photograph of Zanele Muholi Exhibition, Tate Modern, November 2020, Photo by Christian Fregnan via Unsplash Of all the rhetoric employed by gallerists and art dealers to persuade someone to buy an artwork, the most convincing pivots on an artist’s work being acquired by museums. Unfortunately, in the context of selling contemporary African art, this tactic carries far more weight if the museum is located in a western art centre. Museum or institutional validation is seen as so vital that artists CVs or biographies almost always indicate which collections or institutions have acquired their works. Given that most of the main international public and private art museum collections can be viewed online, art buyers are no longer have to rely on in-person encounters with works – which often never make it out of storage – but can nose about and see which African artists have garnered institutional validation. Interestingly –collections at public African museums are not available online. If you had to build a collection - call it the ultimate African museum collection - based on the artworks produced by African artists that have been acquired by the Tate in London, MoMA in New York and say, The Centre Pompidou in Paris, which artists and works would feature in it? A brief study of the works produced by African artists in these three most renowned museums in western art centres revealed, not unexpectedly, that the majority of the works were made by artists from South Africa. Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Ghana are ranked behind SA in 2 nd , 3 rd ,4 th , 5 th place respectively. Of the South African artists that are collected by all three of these world renowned museums are; William Kentridge, David Goldblatt, Zanele Muholi, Guy Tillim, Marlene Dumas, Ernest Cole, Sue Williamson and Ian Wilson, who might not be known to South Africans as he forged his career largely in the US. Egyptian artists that have works in all three museums are; Sameer Makarius and Anna Boghiguian. Nigerian based, but Ghanian born, El Anatsui and John Akomfrah have works in these museums as does Morocco’s Yto Barrada and Mohammed Melehi. Algiers’ Jean-Michel Atlan, Cameroon’s Barthélémy Toguo, and Ethiopian born Julie Mehretu naturally also enjoy institutional validation by these museums. You would need to be a fairly moneyed collector to snag a work by most of these artists, though with the South African photography based artists such as Tillim, Cole and Williamson you could secure a relatively affordable editioned work. South African photographic works appear to be collectable yet – apart from those works made by Goldblatt – are not highly valued on the art market. In other words, a ‘museum’ worthy collection might not always be one that would do well at auction.

RMN-GP, Image reference : 4N82267, Image presentation : l&apos;Agence Photo de la RMN A number of the artists listed above - Dumas, Mehretu, Akomfrah, Toguo - and those that appear in two of these museums’ collections such as Robin Rhode, Candice Breitz, Moshekwa Langa, Otobong Nkanga, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Pascale Marthine Tayou, Sammy Baloji, Wangechi Mutu and Lubaina Himid are settled outside of Africa. This suggests that those artists more likely to enjoy institutional validation in western art centres are more embedded in them. Given the repeated commonalities between the works by African artists in the collections of the Tate, MoMA and Pompidou evinces a shared awareness among the acquisitions boards on which artists’ works should be collected. As such it appears that taste in art, even in the realm of museums, is as circular as it might be in the art market, where the same names keep reappearing and there are discernible waves of interest in certain artists at certain times. Call it herd buying mentality. Why is it that museum validation counts for so much and should art buyers assiduously collect works by artists on whom they confer recognition? One of the main reasons institutional validation is thought to carry so much influence is perhaps, ironically, due to the fact that museums are thought to be divorced from the commercial activities of the art world. Being at a remove from commerce, has situated institutions as objective purveyors of art and taste of it. As museum gatekeepers are thought to be harder to please their ‘judgement is seldom questioned’, suggests Don Thompson in The 12 million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art (2008). Of course, the idea that museums are at a remove from art market may be somewhat of a utopian notion, particularly in countries where there are low if any government funding for acquisitions. This may partly explain why state-owned museums in African countries carry little influence in the market for contemporary African art - expanding their collection depends on collectors donating works but also on galleries and artists donating them. Brought to its knees, the state funded Joburg Art Gallery in that South African city participated in an online art fair last year, offering works by emerging artists for sale. On the face of it they appeared like any dealer. Did their backing add kudos to those artists? Candice Breitz, Him + Her, 1968-2008, Two seven-channel video installations (color, sound), 28:50 min. and 23:56 min, Credit: Gift of Outset Contemporary Art Fund, Copyright: Courtesy of the artist, Image from Museum of Modern Art website In the US where museums rely on private donors and acquisition boards can be populated by collectors with a vested interest in acquiring works by artists already in their own collections so as to increase their value, the notion of the museum as a veritable fortress of independent taste cut off from the art market doesn’t hold much water. Of course, the proliferation of private art museums has seen collectors establish institutions to not only underscore the value of their collections and artists they support but also because they are as “passionate about art and this is how they want to spend their money” according to András Szántó, cultural consultant. The proliferation of art foundations has worked towards driving up the price of art, with billionaires competing for desirable works for their quasi museums and it is in these kinds of spaces that the most prestigious exhibitions are being staged, according to Georgina Adam in The Rise and Rise of the Private Art Museum (2021). As such not only are private museums making it difficult for public ones to acquire art – which is now more expensive – but sometimes, undercutting their programming too. This is chipping away at the status of public museums. In South Africa, the most exciting ‘museum’ quality shows are being staged at private art foundations. Take the Joburg Contemporary Art Foundation’s recent Liminal Identities in the Global South , the first tightly curated African exhibition to bring African and South American female artists’ works into conversation. Perusing through the recent acquisitions by the Tate, MoMA and Pompidou it is clear that they are not necessarily involved in ‘building’ new artists careers but rather collecting those artists who have been validated by the art market or other institutions already. As such they could not be looked upon as ‘market leaders’ where taste in contemporary art is concerned.

RMN-GP, Image reference: 4N94575, Image presentation : l&apos;Agence Photo de la RMN The red-tape and small budgets that public museums even in France - The Centre Pompidou’s acquisition budget was €2-million in 2018 - perhaps make it impossible for them to act ‘fast’ and buy an artwork on a whim – in the manner of the private art foundation. This might be to their credit – they aren’t slaves to the fickle fashions that seem to drive the art market and ‘taste’ is determined by a board rather than that of a single collector or his or her advisors. Where does this leave collectors looking to collect works by artists who have institutional recognition? Ultimately, a single acquisition by a museum or private art museum of an artist’s work isn’t sufficient – you need to establish consensus by a number of museums. At this point the works are likely to be expensive and outdated in terms of their ‘contemporary relevance’ and it will come down to collecting those that are of a museum quality – not every work by an artist with institutional validation is worth buying.

      <title>Is Paris headed for another golden art era?</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/is-paris-headed-for-another-golden-art-era</link>
      <description>Is Paris headed for another golden art era? The recent announcement of Art Basel staging a Paris fair has fuelled speculation around the rise of this European art capital. What will the impact be on the African art market, which has developed in that city? Gagosian, Jack Shainman Gallery, Meleko Mokgosi, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel Pre-war Paris has been a source of nostalgia for art lovers. It is the spectre of France’s golden art era that compels streams of tourists to Montparnasse to do a turn in the bars – La Rotonde, Le Dôme or La Coupole – that were frequented by the heroes of western art; Picasso, Braque, Gauguin, Chagall and Kandinsky. The now cancelled filmmaker Woody Allen transferred this fantasy to celluloid in the 2011 film Midnight in Paris . In it Owen Wilson plays the bumbling writer who steps into one of these Montparnasse bars and finds himself magically transported back in time, rubbing shoulders with the art intelligentsia of Paris’s pre-war era. He seems to squander this opportunity – asking inane questions about his love life. The announcement last week that the Art Basel brand, owned by the MCH Group, will launch a fair in Paris in the venue, the Grand Palais, that had been occupied by the FIAC contemporary art fair, has fuelled further speculation that Paris is due to reclaim its historical status. Indeed it is Paris’ pre-war history that attracted Art Basel to this city. Art Basel in Basel 2021, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel ‘With its incomparable history and contemporary dynamism, Paris is uniquely positioned as a pivotal epicenter (stet) of the international cultural scene,’ stated Marc Spiegler, global director of Art Basel in a press release. ‘We aim to build on Paris’s unparalleled standing as a global metropolis to help create a vibrant week that even further amplifies the city’s international resonance as a cultural capital.’ Art Basel, are, of course, the largest global art fair franchise with fairs in Basel, Hong Kong and Miami. As their success is attributed to the company’s ‘timing&apos;, this move seems to have further added to speculation that Paris was ‘becoming important’ again as London’s status has been waning due to Brexit. Through the lens of the African art market, certainly, Paris is looming as a vital art capital with two French auction houses establishing dedicated contemporary art sales and the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair staging a Paris edition last year. They are planning another one in April of this year. Can an art capital’s importance be gleaned through the status of the fairs or amount of them staged in it? London’s Frieze Art Fair, which started in 2003, was the culmination of what some consider to be London’s ‘Golden Age’, which according to Melanie Gerlis in The Art Fair Story: A Rollercoast Ride , was linked to the rise of a new entrepreneurial class and a booming banking industry, which generated new collectors with an appetite for art that reflected their times and identity. Think of the YBA’s with their cheeky ‘working-class’ aesthetic tied into a sort of punk conceptualism. Rumours that London’s status as one of Europe’s primary art capitals is diminishing only seems to have coincided with Brexit as it would bring to end the free movement of goods from that country to the rest of Europe. In this way London would no longer operate as a nexus to reach European art collectors or to conversely, acquire art made elsewhere in Europe. This is the perception. Art Basel in Basel 2021, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel The UK continues to claim 20% of the art market share with France only securing 6%, according to the UBS Art Market Report 2021. Auction records also suggested that London sales were attracting the more important works, that could or should have been sold in Paris. “On 23 March 2021, Christie’s sold, three key works from the Paris collection of Claude Hersaint (signed Miro, Magritte and Ernst) in London for a total of $31 million,&quot; observed Thierry Ehrmann, founder of Artmarket.com. A similar pattern emerges when you review the kinds of works that come up in dedicated contemporary and modern sales of African art in London in relation to those at the Paris auction houses. In Corrigall &amp; Co’s Modern &amp; Contemporary African Art Auctions 2020/2021 Report , it was found that the turnover of dedicated sales at London-based auction houses (Sotheby’s and Bonhams) outstripped those in Paris, conducted by Piasa and ArtCurial. However, in the period January 2020 to June 2021, there were 7 auctions held in London opposed to four in Paris. Similarly, the most valuable modernist works tend to go under the hammer in London and South Africa – mostly all Irma Stern works – than in Paris. However, within the African art market, the French tend to more highly value modernist and contemporary works that are made by artists from their former colonies – such as Morocco. However, one of the most prized modern artists from that country, Mohamed Melehi’s work has fetched, on average higher prices at Sotheby’s in London, opposed to sales of his work by Artcurial in Paris. Art Basel in Basel 2021, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel Perhaps a close look at the number of galleries dedicated to African art in these two European capitals can shed some more light on this rivalry. In this area they are almost neck on neck, with 17 galleries based in London opposed to 15 in Paris. Paris also now boasts two art fairs dedicated to contemporary African art, AKAA – Also Known as Africa Art Fair – established a fair in that city in 2016, and there is now also 1-54’s Paris edition. The former usually takes place in November, so it will be interesting to see if it will take place in October – to coincide with the Art Basel’s Paris edition. As Frieze London and 1-54 London take place in October in that titular city as well, will collectors, gallerists and art lovers be forced to choose between Paris and London? Only a very few African-based galleries participate in Art Basel and Frieze fairs, which have set high bars in-terms of gatekeeping. Which one will they participate in? Will the London-based auction houses with departments dedicated to African art timed sales in Paris to tie in with the new Basel Paris edition? Bonhams has introduced a Paris sale to coincide with AKAA in 2021. Ultimately, the strengthening of Paris as a capital for art can only benefit the African art market, as it is already a centre for the sale of works from the continent.

      <title>A new generation emerges from Cape Town’s ‘lockdown’</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/a-new-generation-emerges-from-cape-town-s-lockdown</link>
      <description>A new generation emerges from Cape Town’s &apos;lockdown&apos; Image credit: THE FOURTH , got JUNK? exhibition, September 2021 It has been two years since Cape Town’s last bumper art season. Mary Corrigall takes a look at the impact of the absence of foreign visitors on Africa’s major art capital. People have been known to invent reasons to visit Cape Town. Even the most arbitrary conference holds some allure if it happens to be staged at this southernmost tip of Africa. The Clifton beaches, the mountainous vistas that beckon from even the grimiest of locations, the high concentration of chichi restaurants and, an endless array of vineyards (read wine-tastings) to explore beyond the city limits, have made this part of South Africa, and Africa, a major tourist destination. Throw in an art fair, mix in some private art museum shows, add a dash of exclusive VIP cocktail events, stir in a few art auctions, season the concoction with a depreciating local currency and, voilà you have what has fast become Africa’s hottest art capital. In the 2018 South Africa Art Market: Patterns &amp; Pricing study, it was clearly established that Cape Town was indeed the major art capital on the African continent, beating Joburg, Marrakesh and Lagos – the other contenders. Joburg might be the economic centre of the country and boast the highest number of art fairs and galleries, but Cape Town has a higher concentration of second and third-tier galleries and an art fair that draws international dealers. This is largely tied to the constant stream of foreign visitors to the city. Many galleries based in Cape Town have claimed that the largest percentage of sales have been to foreign collectors. As such, the winter season – which brings a slightly unpleasant combo of wind and rain - has proven to be a barren one for many galleries – even smaller ones that you would expect could attract local collectors. For this reason, the Covid-19 pandemic, which proved a barrier for foreign visitors - made Cape Town art dealers very jittery. “There aren’t enough local art collectors to sustain galleries here,” remarked Baylon Sandri, director of SMAC Gallery, towards the end of 2020. Indeed, a number of galleries closed – Smith, Gallery MOMO&apos;s Cape Town branch and German-based ARTCO&apos;s Cape Town space. However, the closure of these galleries wasn’t only related to the impact of the pandemic. For example; the latter had hoped to exploit the foot traffic to the Goodman, which relocated to De Waterkant. Rich Mnisi, To Reflect, Southern Guild, image by Christof van der Walt Given the reliance on foreign visitors to keep the art market in Cape Town ticking over, what has become of it in the last two years since the Investec Cape Town Art Fair staged a live event? Art-making as an activity tends to be carried out in isolation (unless you are a William Kentridge with a large team supporting your production, or a textile-based artist that relies on crafters. As such, the artists in this city had a concentrated time over the last two years to focus without any distractions on their practice. “I was happy to have time at home. I had been wanting to limit my international travel anyway, not only because of the environmental crisis but also because I was needing to work on a project that required an intimate integration of my film work and my painting process,” observed Penny Siopis, who transformed her small Cape Town apartment into a studio. With no travel getting in the way, this period proved more productive than she had anticipated. Penny Siopis, Pinky Pinky (Model Prisoners), 2002 A string of strong solo exhibitions in 2021 across the galleries in Cape Town produced by Chris Soal, Bonolo Kavula, Aviwe Plaatjie, Brett Charles Seiler, Shakil Solanki, Lyndi Sales, Luyanda Zindela, Andile Dyalvane, Kresiah Mukwazhi, Callan Grecia and Rich Mnisi, substantiated not only that artists had been prolific during the pandemic, but as this list suggests, that a largely new generation of artists also drawn from different disciplines took centre stage. This was the result of a marked shift in the gallery programming, which tended towards staging shows by younger or less proven artists. These shows were apparently cheaper to stage and with little foreign foot-traffic gallerists could keep the prices of art lower, take more risks and work at digging into appealing to locals. A focus on emerging talent was mirrored in the kind of growth experienced in the art ecosystem with new spaces opening up to accommodate them. The Fourth, Spaceby (a recent extension of The Fourth), and Jaffer Modern gallery opened alongside some new online galleries such as Plot and Escape 3 . Even Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art (MOCAA) got in on the act of promoting emerging talent rather than the usual consecrated artists, with an unprecedented show titled Home is Where the Art is , featuring art made by pretty much anyone who fancied themselves as artists in the city. They may have taken the sentiment too far, however, this rambling show was by locals for locals and broke with the Zeitz MOCAA&apos;s focus on foreign tourists. Adding to this ‘grass-roots’ turn was the opening of Church on the titular street in the city tucked into a burgeoning art node that includes the AVA, Nel, Eclectica and Worldart galleries. This new project space might have opened with a show by a well-known figure, Thania Petersen, but they have quickly lived up to their risk-taking ethos since, with a string of unconventional installations and performances by emerging talent such as Brian Montshiwa, who covered the interior walls with pink-lipstick kisses during a five-day durational performance. Church&apos;s gold facade at 58 Church Street, image courtesy: Church The notion of a non-commercial space for artists to take risks seemed to please Berni Searle, a veteran artist who has been a focus of a solo exhibition at Frieze London. Her enthusiasm is shaped by her role as an art lecturer at the University of Cape Town. Speaking at the opening of Church she observed that one of the positive outcomes from Covid 19 was the increase in “alternative and emerging spaces that are not driven by commercial ends or controlled by monopolies in the art world. There is so much emphasis placed on polished works. Our students are so influenced by the art world and feel the need to produce work that fits into the neat gallery system, it is important that we have a space to play, we need to survive but it shouldn’t be at the expense of our growth.” You could surmise that the pandemic allowed some players in Cape Town’s art world to reconnect with the source of art – experimentation and driving new forms of expression – rather than simply servicing the tastes of foreign collectors. Even first-tier galleries such as Stevenson seemed to get back in touch with their roots with two group shows, including works by artists that weren’t all in their stable. The Norval Foundation’s new gallery outpost at the Boschendal wine farm followed this trend, featuring a solo exhibit by a young artist working in ceramics, Githan Coopoo, shown alongside art superstar Zanele Muholi. This focus on emerging talent in Cape Town perhaps culminated in The 40 Under 40 exhibition organised by Whatiftheworld Gallery and staged at the Twee Jonge Gezellen Wine Estate outside Tulbagh towards the end of 2021. This rambling show, featuring all manner of works – from ceramic, installation to sound - featured most of the new rising stars that have emerged during this pandemic, alongside some new names and interesting works that previously would never have got a look in, in a group show by this gallery in the city.

However, even this fair has modified its position – allowing more smaller local and new galleries to participate in it that would not have made the cut in the past.

      <title>Judging Africa’s emerging talent</title>

      <description>Judging Africa’s emerging talent On 2 March 2022, Latitudes and ANNA launch the ANNA Award, an annual contemporary art prize for women-identifying artists from South Africa. In the lead up, arts researcher Mary Corrigall surveys the landscape, examining a host of awards that are geared towards identifying Africa’s next art superstar. ----------------- Michaela Younge at her booth at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair, where she was awarded the Tomorrow/Today&apos;s Award. Image credits: Stephanie Veldman There is a dizzying amount of art being produced on the African continent. No one has undertaken a study to establish how much new art is being made on a monthly or yearly basis, probably since it would be akin to chasing butterflies and pinning them down. This fact, can be source of great anxiety for some art collectors. Given there is so much art out there, and often collectors wish to buy art from artists in countries other than their own, yet know little of the artistic or social histories that shape art there, how do you sort between the wheat and the chaff? External or institutional validation of an artist&apos;s practice can help distinguish artists from each other. For established artists, their exhibition history and auction records provide some insight into their standing, commitment to their practice and consensus around the value of their art, but for emerging artists who have yet to rack up a list of exhibitions, it can be trickier to judge whether they are serious and worth supporting. An installation view of the finalists of the Norval-Sovereign Art Prize, which were on exhibit at the eponymous art foundation in Cape Town. Image credits: Mike Hall This is the role awards can play, particularly in a nascent art market where many of them are geared towards identifying, rewarding and further developing emerging talent. As such these awards give such a boost to the artist in terms of their confidence and exposure that in and of itself, the artists who receive them are more likely to succeed due to the recognition. Many of the awards for artists are South African based, however, some evince a pan-African outlook, inviting nominations or entries from other African countries. This includes the newly established Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, which was awarded to a South African artist, Banolo Kavula, however, it included among others a short-list of artists such as Cassi Namoda, the US-based Mozambican artist, Dawit L. Petros from Eritrea, Mohssin Harraki from Morocco and Abraham Onoriode Oghobase from Nigeria. Unexpectedly, the Public Vote Prize went to Rene Travares who lives between Sao Tomé and Lisbon. Many years ago the the Absa L’atelier Award shifted its focus, directly inviting artists from outside South Africa to submit entries to the award, focussing on residents of Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, the Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. However, last year a South African, Abongile Sidzumo, took the main prize, The Gerard Sekoto Award. A South African, Phoka Nyokong, took the award the previous year too, as did the previous one. It is probably hard to beat South African artists on their home-ground, but also because the South African art market is the most developed on the continent. This is connected to high-quality art schools and graduates who exhibit a sophisticated awareness of the kind of art that resonates with trends in contemporary practice. As such often the artists from other African countries who attract these South African awards are based in this country or have studied here. Last year’s winner of the 2021 Cassirer Welz Award bucked this trend. Artist Samuel Nnorom is Nigerian born and educated. Will Nnorom go on to be an African art superstar? Realistically, there are so few superstars, and none of these awards, no matter how well adjudicated or unbiased, can reliably be predictors of this status. At best, they can offer a clue. Take Blessing Ngobeni, who won this award in 2012. It was the succession of other events in his artistic trajectory that hinted at his bright future. Finding suitable candidates is probably one of the biggest challenges for the organisers of these awards; open calls might result in a glut of unsuitable entries. Identifying judges with a broad knowledge of and contact with emerging artists across the African continent is tricky too, given the territory is so massive and very few specialists have an inside track into every art capital. In an attempt to circumvent these pitfalls, the organisers of the Norval-Sovereign award relied on a board comprising of as many as 53 independent arts professionals – “comprising curators and academics who work closely with artists in their respective regions, (who) nominated 158 artists for the Prize.” From there, 30 finalists were shortlisted by a group of respected art professionals from different countries – mostly outside of the African continent. The result was such a varied list of artists at different stages of their careers it was almost impossible to consider how they could validly be judged against each other. Could anyone claim that Kimathi Mafafo’s embroidered figurative works could be compared to one of Esther Mahlangu’s precise Ndebele paintings? As such, while a democratic approach is best, when too many people are involved there may be less focus and consistency. In the end it wasn’t surprising that a hot young artist with a novel vocabulary won the award – jurists will inevitably wish for an award to capture what is considered to be ‘new, now’. Work by the Absa L’Atelier Group B 2021 winner, Ayobola Kekere-Ekun Art fair awards tend to sway between the two poles – recognising rising and then established talent. The Tomorrow/Today’s award title that goes to an emerging artist in this titular section of the fair at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair states the artist’s status. Last week Michaela Young took the award. She has enjoyed several gallery exhibitions and her aesthetic is well-known - as such the recognition seems belated. However, for those collectors who may have been on the fence with regards to acquiring her work this could give them the confidence to take home one of her homely looking felt tableaux creations. The other nominees also naturally share some of the spotlight, particularly given the structure of this award, where each nominee enjoys a solo booth in a prominent position at this annual art fair. The Art X Lagos art fair award singles out an emerging artist but also, much like the Absa L’Atelier award, appears to offer the recipient a chance to be part of a residency outside of their native country. Chigozie Obi, last year’s winner, received a grant towards making work for a solo presentation at ART X Lagos fair but also secured a three-month residency at Gasworks, London. Further, mentorship and support is offered. In this way this award is focussed not only on marking out new talent but identifying one that should be nurtured further. Awards might assist collectors in identifying artists to collect early on in their careers but as they are often philanthropic activities, allowing the sponsors to be seen as ‘giving back&apos; or lending support at a grassroots level, the outcome should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. The judges experience should be scrutinised closely too. The prize attached to the FNB Art Joburg (formerly Joburg Art Fair) has gone through phases of recognising artists who are already on the global art map, such as Billie Zangewa, Bronwyn Katz and Peju Alatise to those that are on the cusp of being acclaimed such as Turiya Magadlela or Haroon Gunn Salie. Few probably recall that Portia Zvavahera, who now is represented by and stages shows at the world-famous David Zwirner gallery, was the recipient of this award in 2014. At the time she won it her work was affordable and within reach. Pre-Covid the recipients of this award would have a solo booth at the fair as well as receive a cash prize. In this way, they benefitted from sales of their works, which were naturally boosted due to the recognition. Norval Foundation and The Sovereign Art Foundation (SAF) declared artist, Bonolo Kavula as the winner of The Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, 2022 The sale of nominees works for awards appears to be a common characteristic of them and more recently this aspect has manifested in the finalists works being auctioned online. This proved a particularly popular trend during Covid-19 when the physical exhibition of works may have been limited or had limited visitors. The RMB Talent Unlocked Programme, The Emerging Painting Invitational (EPI), The Blessing Ngobeni Art Prize, The Cassirer Welz Award and the Norval Sovereign Award all conclude with the finalists works being auctioned. This may be one way for auction houses to support talent at a grassroots level, allow the artists to generate an income from their entries, and raise their profile among the collectors who trawl through these auctions looking for low value works that may rise in value at a later stage. However, it may also be too early for some of the artists to have their works sold in the secondary market, which is usually reserved for proven artists. Given this, the sell-through rates are not particularly high. Securing secondary market sale records early on in an artist&apos;s career can be a boost, however, conversely not selling any works could prove to put a damper on future sales. Bonolo Kavula as the winner of The Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, 2022 “The rigid separation between primary and secondary markets and the dangers to reputation of artists formerly through participation in auctions simply do not apply any more. Hybrid is the name of the present moment especially in the context of Africa where Eurocentric legacy structures are not particularly relevant. Our first auction in 2020 was a remarkable success giving much needed income to young artists and creating fantastic new opportunities through visibility like gallery representation exhibition projects entry into major collections,” said Valerie Kabov, founder of the EPI award. The pricing and bidding transparency that these online auctions for award finalists entails certainly gives collectors and dealers insight into which artists the ‘market’ responds to most, generating perhaps another round of ‘judgement’ marking out another set of winners and losers. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based art advisor, journalist and researcher. - Latitudes and ANNA are set to launch the ANNA Award on 2 March.

      <title>Central and West African artists are penetrating the South African Art Market</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/central-and-west-african-artists-are-penetrating-the-south-african-art-market</link>
      <description>Valued Central and West African artists are penetrating the South African Art Market Up until recently the secondary market for works by artists from Central and West Africa has largely been established in France and the UK. Aspire Art&apos;s March sale could be turning the tide. ---------------------- Paul Kodjo, Extrait du roman photo &quot;Perdue et retrouvée&quot;, 1973, Presented by Aspire Art Artists from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other central African countries, such as Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, have been a part of curatorial conversations surrounding contemporary African art in Europe since the mid-noughties, when they started gaining traction in museums. Due to the colonial ties with France and Belgium and a shared language, more narrow, regionally focussed exhibitions establishing contemporary artists from those regions took place in those European countries. Among others, such exhibitions included, Popular Painting (curated by Bambi Ceuppens and Sammy Baloji) at the Bozar for popular Fine Arts in Brussels, and the Beauté Congo 1926-2015 Congo Kitoko curated by Andre Magin for the Foundation Cartier in Paris , while Popular Painting From Kinshasa , showed at the Tate Modern. This established a market for artists included in those shows and quickly translated into them featuring on auctions offering African art in London and Paris. As a result, high-profile European collections dedicated to art from the African continent almost always include works by those first-generation contemporary artists from the Congo or Ivory Coast who came to define this &apos;category&apos;. Yet, in South Africa, exposure to art from the DRC and other central and West African countries has been limited. Zemba Luzamba, &lt; Swag &gt;, Presented by Aspire Art Few works by artists from these regions have been shown at exhibitions in South Africa. As such, collectors are paying attention to the upcoming Aspire Art&apos;s sale taking place in Cape Town on March 16, as it includes many works by celebrated artists from central and west Africa, with largely proven auction records. With works by older generation artists - Frédéric Bruly Bouabré (Ivory Coast), Pilipili Mulongoy (Congo), Roger Botembe Mimbayi (DRC) and Chéri Cherin, to a younger set including Joseph Eze, William Chechet (both from Nigeria), Arim Andrew (Uganda) and Zemba Luzamba (DRC). Williams Chechet, Kaboom II, Presented by Aspire Art This central, west African flavour to the auction is no doubt a product of this auction house’s relationship with prestigious French auction houses, where the above-mentioned artists&apos; works are an almost permanent fixture on African art sales. In a sale conducted by Artcurial in March last year, every work by Mulongoy sold and all, but one, fetched sums that far exceeded the high-estimates set for them. In the Forest (1995), a characteristic work by Mulongoy, presenting an idyllic natural scene, offered at the Aspire Art sale is priced at a modest R80 000. Joseph Eze, Tribal Blue Vuitton, Presented by Aspire Art While works by Luzamba have typically excelled on African-focussed sales in France, last year in October, Luzamba’s Social Report (2018) fetched more than R300 000 at an auction conducted by Christie’s in London. Notably, this record wasn’t set at an African focussed auction, but one boasting works by desirable contemporary artists from around the world, proving that Congolese art is no longer limited to collectors with an African focus. Swag (2019), which features two dapper men – a common motif in Luzamba’s art - is on offer at the Aspire Art for R100 000. It is typical for the Congolese painter to present his subjects detached from a context. The Ivorian photographer, Paul Kodjo, also offers a compelling stylised image of a man with swagger in one of the images contained in an archival collection offered at this auction. He appears powerful, despite being seated, and a female subject towers over him. The series plots out a fictional photo story steeped in seventies aesthetics. The artists from these different central and west African countries are influenced by specific regional conditions, aesthetics, and movements. However, it would be easy to make a case for the enduring influence of the ‘popular painters’ from the DRC on the sort of pop-figurative art produced by the likes of Eze, Andrew, Luzamba and countless others. A collection of African art could be deemed incomplete if it doesn’t include works by Chéri Cherin, Chéri Samba or others from the so-called ‘popular painters’ movement that took hold in central Africa from the late ‘70s. The allegorical, socio-political figurative painting that characterises this movement, has come to represent a view of contemporary art from central and west Africa and is included in French-owned collections by Jean Pigozzi and The Leridon collection. Roger Botembe Mimbayi, Dialogue, Presented by Aspire Art Interestingly, it is more recent works by these artists that have been commanding high prices at auction. A 2017 work, La Plus Belle Femme Afrique, (The Most Beautiful Women are African ) fetched £22 000 (R440 000) at Bonhams, London in 2019. In line with contemporary works produced by ‘popular painters,’ the work by Cherin (Joseph Kinkonda) offered on this auction, titled La liberation de la Conscience Creatrice Emprisonnee (The release of the imprisoned creative consciousness ) features a maternal figure. Where once this would symbolise the consciousness of a nation for Cherin, this leitmotif now represents the creative mind, which is clearly hungry for inspiration. Nigerian artists such as Eze or Uganda’s Andrew, embrace the use of symbolism in their own ‘popular painting’ style, though both, as per the current portraiture trend, focus on a single subject. The bright palette rendered in flat colours continues the Congolese style yet it is markers of wealth that define the subjects – a Louis Vuitton scarf in Eze’s Tribal Blue Vuitton (2016) and a bottle of expensive champagne in Andrew’s Belaire here, Belaire there (2018). Arim Andrew, Belaire Here, Belaire There, Presented by Aspire Art The opportunity to make connections between this older generation of artists from the DRC with a younger set coming out of Nigeria and Uganda, where the portraiture trend is at its peak, and South African artworks can be done in person in Cape Town at Aspire Art&apos;s premises from March 8 to 16. - Latitudes Staff writer Aspire Art&apos;s Modern and Contemporary Art auction will take place on Wednesday 16 March 2022 at 19:00 in Cape Town REGISTER TO BID HERE View our highlights from Aspire Art&apos;s upcoming auction</description>

      <title>European auctions of African art led by contemporary works</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/european-auctions-of-african-art-led-by-contemporary-works</link>
      <description>Is Isshaq Ismail the next Amoako Boafo? --------------------------------- El Anatsui, Revelations, 2021, aluminium bottle caps and copper wire The results from the March auction sales dedicated to African art in Europe are in, and they reflect confidence in contemporary art, with young artists driving a speculative gaze. Is Isshaq Ismail the next Amoako Boafo? It is not simply that this artist also hails from Ghana, but his works are drumming up a storm of money on the international auction circuit with works being sold at Christies, Philips and Sotheby’s for figures that are sometimes 700% over the estimates set for them. His practice appears to be focused on portraits, or at least those are the works valued at auction. That said, he embraces a particularly expressive and individual style. Works by Ismail did well at the Sotheby’s dedicated African contemporary and Modern sale in London yesterday (22 March) with three works fetching well over the high-estimates set for them and new records being set. Nkabom 2, an acrylic on canvas work depicting two heads, fetched £277 200 (R5,4million). He was, however, one of only a handful of contemporary artists gaining such high figures across all the March African auctions held in Europe this month. With Bonhams and Sotheby’s and Paris-based Artcurial all staging their African contemporary and modern sales in March, it has become an important month for collectors focussed on this market. The results of these sales are indicative of what tastes in African art are guiding the international secondary market in Europe and, more generally, confidence in the African art market. Of course, the absence of auction houses on the African continent where there is a strong level of art production (Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia) also means these sales are determined by collectors in or of African descent. In this way the results of these auctions over insight into where the global and local interests intersect. Isshaq Ismail, Nkabom 2, acrylic on canvas One of the striking features that marked all these sales was a noticeable absence of high-valued modernist works. There were a few sellers hoping to cash in on the recent death of Yusuf Grillo, the acclaimed Nigerian artist who was taken by Covid-19 late last year. Bonhams may have set a record for the artist with Dancing Bride , which achieved over double its high estimate at £350 000 (R6-million). Largely, however, the high-achieving works were produced by contemporary artists. Aside from Ismail, works by Aboudia (Abdoulaye Diarrassouba) the young Ivorian artist whose been lapping up all the auction attention across the globe with his characteristic urban art head motifs, are still finding traction in the African art market. Any artists boasting high figures at Christies are going to do well on these dedicated sales, which are somewhat like boutiques for those with an interest in this niche market or are looking to ‘internationalise’ or ‘diversify’ their collections, as per gallery parlance. There are those too, looking to make a quick buck. Sadly, the market for African art on the global stage is often driven by speculation. Just last year, the auction houses couldn’t hold onto a work by Otis Kwame Kye Quaicoe, also a Ghanian artist keen on portraiture, yet both works offered by Bonhams earlier this month did not exceed the high estimates set for them. Works by Oluwole Omofemi, the Nigerian artist known for portraits of women with exaggerated hairdos, also scored higher figures than expected in the London sales. However, generally, only a handful of artists&apos; works are doing so. Are the auction houses being too bullish with their figures, or are buyers feeling shy in the face of another impending catastrophe in Europe that the war in Ukraine has triggered? Oluwole Omofemi, Untitled, oil and acrylic on canvas All in all, the Sotheby’s sale was the most successful, however, they tend to secure the highest turnover. The good results may have been down to the fact that 25 works were donated to raise funds for the CCA Lagos, a non-profit art centre in that African city established by the late Bisi Silva. The sell-through rate was almost 80%, which is becoming an increasingly unlikely result in the African art market, where last year European sales dedicated to this category (across all markets including Africa) was on average 63%, according to Corrigall &amp; Co’s 2020/2021 African Art Modern Contemporary Auction report. As such it wasn’t too much of a surprise that the sell-through rate of the Artcurial’s Africa online sale last week was hardly high, at 56%. This French auction house, which only previously conducted a sale of African art in Morocco once a year, is slowly building the market. In March last year they opted for a sale dedicated to artists from the so-called Hangar School, which was a great success. Artists from this period and producing work in this style such as Pilipili Mulongoy and Mwenze Kibwanga, were included in this sale but unlike last year’s, none of the works fetched figures above the high estimates set for them. The three artists&apos; works that performed well on the Paris online sale were produced by Aboudia, Médéric Turay and Cyprien Tokoudagba. Two of the works by Aboudia (from the Baramôgô series) were made over a decade ago – largely the works that come to auction are recently produced. It was refreshing to see more earthy tones and collaged elements, and while head motifs can be detected in the works they are less defined, more varied. He hadn’t found his signature yet, so it is interesting to dial back and see how he developed it. Few could have predicted that Turay’s Club 27 would do so well on this auction, though his works have done well at other Paris sales conducted by Piasa. This multimedia collage work, depicting singers and artists who died at the age of 27, set a record for this artist, who fortunately has lived beyond the age of 27 (fetching €34 000, or R555 000) . Bonhams sale, which unlike the others was conducted live (and online), enjoyed a fairly robust sell-through rate of 69%. Abdoulaye Aboudia Diarrassouba, Untitled, mixed media on canvas All four works by Aboudia exceeded the high estimates set for them. An Untitled work from 2016 set for £60 000 sold for £237 000 (R4,6 million). It was rewarding to finally see a good result for a work by Ibrahim Mahama, the Ghanaian artist known for working with disused sacks. Typically, his works don’t sell, but that may be down to insignificant or ‘incomplete’ works coming to auction - read scraps of his jute materials. Mahama’s Kawokudi , created 2013, which encompassed an entire installation, fetched a healthy £22 000 (R432 000). Receptiveness to Mahama’s work, as no doubt is the case for many African artists working with disused materials or hanging textile works, rests with the pioneering Ghanaian artist El Anatsui. Naturally, works by this artist come up on London auctions dedicated to this category frequently, but we are more used to seeing his earlier carved wooden panel works than his rambling bottle top ones that he has become so famous for. As such it was exciting to spot the work, Revelations , on the Sotheby’s sale. As similar works – in terms of medium and size – have fetched over £1million (R20million) it was hoped this one could too, particularly given it was made by the artist to raise funds for the CCA Lagos. Silva had dedicated much time to writing about and curating works by Anatsui, so this work was the artist’s way of paying tribute to the acclaimed Nigerian curator and her work. It ended up fetching £693 000 (R13,6million), which should go a long way to ensuring the longevity of that essential art centre.

      <title>A dive into Bonita Alice&apos;s Practice</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/a-dive-into-bonita-alices-practice</link>
      <description>A DIVE INTO BONITA ALICE&apos;S PRACTICE &quot;My interest has long been with matters psychological. In recent years my focus has been the emotional space between human and non-human animals and the inherent disquiet that haunts it. The problem of articulating that troubled and complicated space visually is what preoccupies me.&quot; ----------------------- Bonita Alice, Treachery, Lies and Lamentation , 2011, woollen dust and archival glue on paper, each tondo approx 35 cm unframed, framed installation approx. 2mx2m Bonita Alice (b. 1962) studied at the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Cape Town in South Africa and taught in several Fine Art Departments until 2003. She spent 12 years in London before moving back to South Africa in 2020. Alice&apos;s studio practice reflects her interest in animal studies, a growing, global, cross-disciplinary field in which attempts are made to better understand human and animal relationships. Alice is particularly interested in aspects within psychology and psychoanalysis which she believes are useful in understanding the abuse of animals and the environment. &quot;My practice reflects my preoccupation with the crisis of our age … environmental degradation and our apparent inability, as a species, to properly register our role in it; to act to rescue the situation and ultimately, ourselves. My focus has long been with psychological matters and our relationship with other animals. In our resistance to the idea of the suffering and annihilation of other species, despite the intense emotional closeness we share with some of them, I suspect a kind of madness. -------------------------------------------------------- Sorry Series Alice&apos;s Sorry series is rooted in the notion of selective awareness, the idea that forms the basis of our understanding of human psychology and the workings of the unconscious; we understand that we protect ourselves from the harsher aspects of our lived reality even as we live it. The lattice form that gives structure to each image in the Sorry series mimics a decorative screen, like that which might partially obscure a protected space, as in a confessional or harem chamber; a place of theatricalised separation. The wool dust is a reference to transience, but also evokes something softened or cushioned, as if to protect the vulnerable. These dust drawings are rooted in the central idea of psychoanalytic thought, that, even our most ordinary daily experience, we repress into the unconscious that which hurts us too much. This idea is central to my understanding of our destructive relationship with what we call ‘nature’, as if nature is something that exists outside of ourselves. Ultimately we are inconsistent and unreliable in accepting our duty of care to a shared environment, as if we can’t bear our closeness and interdependence. Bonita Alice, Sorry 9 , woollen dust and archival glue on paper Bonita Alice, Sorry 10 , woollen dust and archival glue on paper Eremocene, 2021 *Eremocene means, an Age of Loneliness, a name American biologist, E.O.Wilson, has proposed for the coming time, when humans have destroyed most other life forms on Earth. &apos;Not everyone gets marble. Some lives—and some deaths—are given more weight than others. We know this to be true of the human realm and much has been said about the injustice that underlies it. Across all beings, it is particularly so that some lives are valued more than others, and much less is said about that. Our routine acceptance of the deaths of ‘nonhumans’ – in unimaginable numbers and by violent means - is incomprehensible when you consider that most humans are empathic, and also squeamish about the spilling of blood. Yet, it remains a rare and specialised enterprise to think about those deaths, and most of us don’t. Or can’t. We’re somehow inured. I’m endlessly curious about how my species maintains that emotional separation. And when it comes to the finality of a species’ extinction, do we even begin to understand or feel the loss? We keep count of the numbers lost, but where is the grieving?&apos; - Bonita Alice Bonita Alice, Endling 2 , Jelutong, 2021, length: 85 cm In 1996, two administrators of a convalescent centre in the US state of Georgia wrote to Nature journal proposing that a name was needed for an individual that is the last of its kind. Nature invited suggestions from their readers… “Among the suggestions were ‘terminarch,’ ‘ender,’ ‘relict,’ ‘yatim,’ and ‘lastline,’ but the new word that stuck was ‘endling.’ Of all the proposed names, it is the most diminutive (like duckling or “fingerling”) and perhaps the most storied (like ‘End Times’). The little sound of it jingles like a newborn rattle, which makes it doubly sad.’ - Elena Passarello, Animals Strike Curious Poses (2018) Bonita Alice, Beast Dead, 2014, Acrylic on paper 56.7 x 38 cm (framed 620 x 540 cm) Eremocene installation, Everard Read, Cape Town at their August Cubicles Exhibition, Photo credit: Michael Hall Beast at Home, 2010 &quot;We are familiar by now with the idea of our own unconscious as foreign territory...The Other where we least expect to find it. If Utopia is an imagined, distant and longed-for place, (and dystopia a distant place we fear), we need to make this interior zone a focus in discussions about connection to place. For years I looked for meaning in the bond we have with some or other place. Nationhood and history must count for something. But I think I understand a little better now that what we desire so fiercely is somewhere even more remote than motherland.&quot; - Bonita Alice Bonita Alice, And Fear Too , 2009, wool, dust &amp; archival glue on paper Bonita Alice, We lived among people who vainished into exile, 2009, wool, dust &amp; archival glue on paper Spirit I and II, Site Specific Works, 1998-2002 These works were made using a technique of grass painting used to mark the pitch for televised sports events. Anamorphic perspective is employed to create the illusion of 3-dimensions when the work is viewed from a prescribed height and distance. Spirit I and II were commissioned for the 25th Sao Paulo Bienal in 2002.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/nicole-rafiki-s-solo-show-the-king-herself</link>
      <description>Nicole Rafiki’s solo show | The King Herself -------------------------- Alexander Helle, Nicole Rafiki and T-Michael Nicole Rafiki, a Norway-based Congolese visual artist - who uses symbolism to challenge stereotypes in a critical way, was commissioned to create an exhibition for the opening of Norwegian design duo T Michael and Alexander Helle&apos;s Norwegian Rain/T-Michael&apos;s new hybrid space at Oslobukta (same area as the new Munch Museum and the Norwegian Opera house). The collaborative show is entitled &quot;The King Herself&quot; and will be on view until 31 May. Rafiki uses symbolism to re-imagine and challenge the stereotypical depiction of spaces, contexts and the people who are affected by global migration. According to the prolific artist, she views her work as a platform for dialogues about identity, fluidity, place, and belonging, adding that, as an artist with a diverse cultural, historic and artistic background, she uses art to inform, engage and heal, because it is too easy to fall into the trap of promoting idealism or clichés, and she makes it a point to be critical and analytical in her work. T- Michael, the curator of her new solo show says: My fascination and appreciation of Nicole Rafiki&apos;s work stems from her fearless stance on anything she feels passionate about. This attribute is lacking in the zeitgeist we are in. We are easily dissuaded or persuaded, and the resulting effect strengthens the already prevalent numbness in our society. Socio-political art is essential to our unlearning of the ongoing detrimental effects of all that we’ve learned over the past 300 years. One could debate or argue over the effect of the aforementioned indoctrination or one could effect a change, from one’s own front porch. I want you all to go in and indulge in Nicole’s work firstly as a beautiful interpretation of her sensory perceptions. Just that. On your way home to the safeness of your abode, do ponder on the numbness in our society. Or not. Either way, I will still be fascinated by Nicole’s art and intellect. Peruse well. Noemi Y. Molitor, ph.d. Berlin based visual artist and researcher writes that: the work of Nicole Rafiki reaches across time. It walks through loss and traverses the globe. Her artistic techniques – if &apos;technique&apos; is even the right word to describe her practise-based intuitive methodology – encompasses photography and/as storytelling, careful forms of textile contact, and deep research into cultural symbolisms and forms of ritual, a research, which in turn becomes ritual as history writing. The histories Nicole Rafiki invokes in her artworks are of both geo-political dimension and personal depth. The seven images that are at the center of Rafiki’s exhibition „The King Herself“ take as their starting point one of the most intimate experiences of time: finitude as it is experienced in the loss of a loved one, through the loss of family. Each of the photographic works on show is a different step in a process of mourning Rafiki underwent after the recent loss of both of her grandmothers. After having been based in Norway for many years, Rafiki had just started out on a path of return to her grandmothers in Kongo in order to study particular artistic symbols and practices passed down in Luba culture where part of her spiritual and cultural heritage reside. The sudden loss of both of them right before this moment of reconnection left the artist with a sense of being severed from her roots. Nicole Rafiki, 2022, We went back and fetched it, digital pigment dye on canvas The works on show are a response to this to uprooting, a form of auto-portrait as much as they are a kind of auto-healing. Reading the images as panels from left to right – which is only one possible direction of approaching them – conveys different stages of grief that run through the artist’s body. In the first image on the left, the artist is lying on the floor on embroidered cloth. A rug perhaps, mirroring the sensation of having the carpet pulled away from under your feet in the face of the death of another. Here in the image however, the cloth grounds the artist, carrying her as she pauses to rest from the manifold loss that has occurred. Nicole Rafiki, 2022, We have arrived, digital pigment dye on canvas About to share in the experience and memories of her grandmothers, Rafiki’s immediate connection to them may have been cut off abruptly. Her artworks however, speak to the ways in which she has managed to transform this state of being severed into a channeling of connections that reach even further back through time to other ancestors past. The process that leads to Rafiki’s photographs is less the staging for a particular scene, but crafting the photographic elements becomes part of the work, a kind of durational performance to which the resulting photographic works only form one element of many. In said first image, her hand holds a Lukasa, a Luba memory board used for recounting historical events during spiritual rituals or political deliberations. Rafiki may not have been trained formally in how to trace the different beads on the board with her fingers in order to use it as a mnemonic device for narration, but the tracing of connections she practices in her work are themselves based on a kind of oral history, a transfer of knowledge that reaches for intergenerational contact and follows a different epistemology, one that is not primarily invested in visual ‚proof’ or first hand ‚evidence’. What can learning – a being taught even if one is not being taught through things handed down directly – look like? Rafiki has conjured different colors and memorial objects, both old and new, to forge her own space of connection with those who walked before her, ranging from a bright red portable music box that provides solace, to Converse shoes that reach across time to the 1930s, and connect back to yet another continent, where the sneaker company became one of the first companies to sponsor an all-Black basketball team, the New York Renaissance, or &quot;Rens“. Walking in someone else’s shoes takes on a deeper meaning when you need to go on without those who came before you. Is there a way for empathy to travel from the past to the future rather than only being directed toward those we see when looking back? The images in „The King Herself“, for one, circle back through time. They can be read in reverse, or in no particular order at all. Mourning, after all, is not a teleological journey at the end of which the goal is to leave something, or someone, behind. It requires an understanding of circular time, and of circular experience. As Rafiki emerges as a self-taught practitioner of Luba practices of healing, mourning has become a kind of time travel. From here, the images take off in the direction of a wider picture, panning toward the question of how knowledge is passed on through time on a geopolitical level. As a Congolese artist who has long lived in the diaspora both on the African and the European continent, Rafiki is an artist of many localities, of movements both voluntary and involuntary. The point of describing her work thus does not lie in uncovering the reasons for such movements – sharing or not sharing them is up to the artist. What jumps to the eye of the viewer immediately however, is how the eyes and face are often covered in Rafiki’s work, by beads, hair, braided fabric or simply by pulling a T-shirt over one’s face or turning the back toward the lens. This technique is also displayed in a couple of the images on show here in Oslo. Rafiki encountered Norway as a place where racial scripts of perception are already written. Deflecting the white gaze, turning it back on itself by preventing the soul of the photographed to be accessed or stolen through the eyes, as she puts it, is a self-protective measure against colonial mechanisms of ordering that are rooted in conventions of ethnographic photography and that expect the photographed to enact something that a western mind has already envisioned. Nicole Rafiki, 2022, We dream new dreams when the sky is blue , digital pigment dye on canvas Choosing to engage in &quot;auto-ethnography“ instead, Rafiki composes her own script of meanings, making her own kind of ritual or ceremony. One of which is letting go of the focus on the final printed picture. Rafiki’s photographic practice happens at multiple points in time so that all the steps that make a picture – from choosing a location to the choice of clothing and dress, objects and colors, to asking other artists to become subjects and collaborators – become part of the artistic practice equally until it is undecipherable when and where the photographs began and what their duration will be. Rafiki’s auto-ethnographic strategy also lets it become clear that the impulse of immediately reading the exhibition title as genderqueer or identifying some kind of feminist ‚nakedness‘ in her images, can easily miss the mark of what is at play. Rafiki is not naked, she is clothed otherwise. Color can serve as a kind of dress and dousing herself in Tukula, a red pigment from ground redwood, or showing herself steeped in a dark bluish black hue, Rafiki conjures notions of cleansing oneself from colonial history (red) and personal rebirth (black), bringing these colors as close to her skin as possible. Unlearning to fall back into a westernized standard of reading pictures, be they pop cultural products or presented in an art-historical context, is a welcome side effect of Rafiki’s show. The larger artistic project she is building, and of which the images that form her hexaptych form an integral part, is a project that consists of and speaks to many polyphonic contexts and localities. At its heart is a conjuring of pre-colonial notions of fluidity that existed long before nation-states and colonial borders. Rafiki’s images speak to pre-colonial forms of aesthetics, pan-African kinds of knowledge productions, and modes of global interconnectedness that precede the white Western imperial project and its colonialist gaze. Hers is a world of art rather than a hegemonic art world as we know it today with its white gates, classist keepers and neoliberal mechanisms of ``divide and conquer‘. In her artistic practice, Rafiki is not so much preoccupied by a gesture of refusal that placates how frequently Black bodies are asked to be molded into tokens of racial diversity. Those themes come to mind precisely because Rafiki is not lost in answering to them. As she words it, she is not in the business of performing Blackness: „I am not a public gesture“. Rather, she has dedicated herself to exploring artistic forms of healing vis-à-vis living in a post-colonial present with its multiple transatlantic pasts and intertwined continuities. The „auto-ethnography“ she practices with her artworks is also a practice of collectivity, a realised belief in the coevalness of places and spirits, futures, presents and pasts. &quot;The best time to live is while we are alive. Let&apos;s do this, chale!&quot; - Nicole Rafiki</description>

      <description>Luxury fashion house, Gucci, collaborates with Cinthia Sifa Mulanga for its latest campaign ------------------------------------------- Cinthia Sifa Mulanga photographed by Earl Garth Abrahams Cinthia Sifa Mulanga’s paintings of female subjects trapped in interior spaces chimed with the times. Now she will be overturning ideals of beauty through an artwork commissioned by Gucci, to celebrate the fashion house&apos;s iconic Diana tote bag. VISIT CINTHIA SIFA MULANGA&apos;S VIEWING ROOM Few artists made a name for themselves during Covid-19 and the lockdowns that forced everyone into isolation. Without live exhibitions, fairs and gatherings, it seemed as if there weren’t opportunities for unknown artists to elicit attention or generate a wave of interest. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga bucked this trend, quickly gaining attention on Latitudes Online with a series of paintings that immediately suggested the artist possessed that elusive signature that artists and collectors seek out. Two years on, there are still waiting lists for her works, the prices of them have increased substantially, she has shown her paintings at local and international art fairs, is in discussion with a first-tier African gallery to exhibit works and has been commissioned by Gucci to create an artwork that celebrates the Diana tote bag. This is not bad going for a twenty-five-year-old artist who only launched onto the scene during the pandemic. “It has definitely been surprising. I was really taken aback,&quot; says Mulanga, of the invitation to be featured in Gucci&apos;s latest campaign. &quot;I&apos;m only now digesting what has happened and starting to understand the impact of my work and how different it is.” Mulanga was tasked with featuring the iconic Gucci Diana tote bag, in a new piece, commissioned by the Italian fashion house. First introduced in 1991, the bag was popularised by and later named after Diana, Princess of Wales. The collaborative process, which saw many versions sent back and forth between Johannesburg and Milan, resulted in the below artwork, Moment. Moment , the artwork created as a collaboration between Cinthia Sifa Mulanga and Gucci to celebrate the iconic Gucci Diana tote bag From the beginning, Mulanga’s paintings brought Teresa Firmino’s collage paintings or Sam Nthlengethwa’s interior scenes to mind – and indeed Mulanga confirms she was inspired by their work. However, in Mulanga’s interiors, which are peopled by black women and collaged images of representations of them, it was immediately clear she was driving a focused engagement with black female identity and ideals of beauty as depicted in popular culture and western art. You have this sense that her female subjects are in a waiting room, biding their time until they are granted entry into a painting or portrait. Representations of women surround them, testing their self-confidence. The use of perspective and the visual planes and windows Mulanga introduces through the use of other images, collaged or painted, which decorate the interior spaces that form the backdrop in her works, brings to mind early Renaissance painting and portraiture – think of the famous Arnolfini Portrait by Jan Van Eyck. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Éléments in Her Finest, 2022 Mulanga confirms that she was influenced by art from the Renaissance era which was introduced to her while studying printmaking at the Artist Proof Studio, a Johannesburg printmaking institution. Her close study of paintings from this era not only turned her onto the use of perspective and interior décor in situating subjects in a milieu, but also ignited an interest in how female subjects have been portrayed in western art – and, of course, the absence of black women in this canon and the ramifications of this for black subjectivity and the ideals of beauty. It was her older brother that turned her onto art and after joining an art programme she embarked on a part-time course in printmaking at the Artist Proof Studio. She had been dabbling with collage, but it was at this Johannesburg institution that she says she developed an awareness of composition and the placing of the collaged elements. It is not quite that her interest and exposure to Renaissance era painting propelled her to ‘rewrite’ this history and insert black subjects. She suggests that her ‘model’ for her paintings evolved organically, unconsciously and emerged from a deep and personal awareness of how a western-white-centric view of beauty had impacted her. “The (traditional) Barbie doll was my primary (point of) reference. Growing up there were few references of black women, so we had no role models to look up to that allowed us to feel beautiful. I wasn’t able to see someone in popular culture that looked like me. It made me aware that more black women needed to be represented. I was interested in how they try to be beautiful or what measures are used to determine this, whether it is through their hair or the tone of their skin.” Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Self Sureness, 2021 Mulanga is interested in exploring the different layers informing constructs of beauty. “It is used to defend the fantasies of men, but it is also determined by women – they often look down on each other.” Yet she doesn’t characterise herself as a feminist artist per se. “I still have to wrap my mind around what my version of feminism looks like,” she says. Her art chimed with the times. During the lockdown, the murder of George Floyd propelled an awareness of how racism had permeated all spheres and black women graced the covers of fashion magazines at an unprecedented rate. The domestic settings that are a signature of her art struck a chord too; during the pandemic, people were trapped in their homes and forced to negotiate how these intimate spaces were a reflection of themselves. Reports of an increase in domestic abuse against women, also fed into the art or her thinking about women in domestic spaces, says Mulanga. In this way, her art dug into some of the major socio-political shifts that took place during the pandemic, so it is perhaps no surprise that her work proved so popular. As domestic interiors are normally associated with safety and comfort, she was interested to pursue and question whether this was the case for her female subjects and by proxy the viewer, too. Mulanga implies that an inner dialogue flourishes in a domestic space, which isn’t just a reflection of the self – through one’s personal taste - but is a space for contemplation. “What are the conversations that we have at home that we wouldn&apos;t normally have in other spaces?” she asks Indeed, in her paintings there appears to be no escape for the female subjects – few open doors or windows hint at an exterior world. This doesn’t only bring lockdowns to mind; these interior spaces can operate as a metaphor for the female psyche or perhaps internalised patriarchal discourse that limits their lives. She suggests it is also where her subjects find comfort, and retreat from the world, though the collaged images that populate the walls, bearing images that relate to representations of women suggest that expectations bear down on her black female subjects. Movement, displacement and seeking out ‘safe spaces’ are pertinent issues for the Lubumbashi-born artist, who arrived in South Africa when she was nine years old in 2006. “It&apos;s been challenging to settle down and to adapt,” she says. The war and political conflict in her native Democratic Republic of the Congo had forced her family to relocate. Finding a ‘safe space’ and a comfort zone in South Africa took time and the xenophobic attacks which took hold in the country in and from 2008 had an indelible impact on the young Mulanga. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, detail from &apos;Her Little Closet&apos;, 2022 “There was a time when we didn’t want to speak in a taxi because we didn’t know the language and we didn’t want to get caught or harmed. The taxi driver would be asking questions and we just kept quiet out of fear that if we pronounced the words incorrectly he would know we are not South African. If we would speak in English he would ask why we are not speaking in Zulu. It was difficult.” You are left with the impression that her mother held the family together through this period of transition in their adopted country. Her paintings appear to substantiate this, as Mulanga cites her mother’s multi-faceted identity as the inspiration behind the female subjects that manifest in so many guises. “Women can do and be more than just one thing; they can keep changing to suit their own needs,” she observes. For now, painting, being an artist is working for Mulanga, she has found her métier, and now that the campaign she worked on for the Gucci Diana bag has been released, she is likely to rise to further prominence. In a way, she couldn’t ask for a better canvas to project her discourse on beauty and black female iconography.

      <title>The Global Art Market Bounces Back</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/the-global-art-market-bounces-back</link>
      <description>The global art market bounces back, according to the latest report Dr Clare McAndrew explains the findings of the latest Art Basel &amp; UBS Art Market Report, Courtesy Art Basel, © Art Basel The annual Art Basel &amp; UBS Art Market Report finds that in 2021 the art market recovered, while NFTs boomed. We break down the most relevant findings in this lengthy report. The global art market certainly dipped in 2020, but has recovered in 2021, though not recouping the same figures achieved in 2019. Conversely, the NFT art market experienced an upward trajectory during and since the Covid-19 pandemic. These are two of the significant findings from the recently released Art Basel &amp; UBS Art Market 2022 report compiled by Dr Clare McAndrew. Sales figures for art in 2021 are healthier than the previous year but not at the same level as they were prior to the pandemic. In 2019 overall sales of art in the global art market were estimated at $40.5 billion and in 2021 they reached $36.7 billion, however, this is an improvement from 2020 when sales totalled 31,4 billion. As such, a recovery is afoot, though gradual. As the report was produced before Russia’s war in Ukraine, it doesn’t delve into the impact that conflict could be having on the art market, which is likely to be fairly extensive given; auction houses cancelled sales in Russia, dealers rely on sales to Russian oligarchs and most importantly the increase in the cost of transporting art, particularly to China. At 270 pages this annual report doesn’t make for light reading, is expectedly Euro-American centric and is not as ‘global’ as it purports to be, however, as it is the only one of its kind, and has established a baseline from which changes can be measured. As always, the African art market hardly figures in the report – mostly due to the fact that art ecosystems are in their nascence on the continent, but also due to the focus on high-end art and antique businesses – there is little clarity as to the percentage of antiques to art dealers in the study. As such, the African share of the art market is not even a blip on the global screen, so to speak. Umar Rashid and Frohawk Two Feathers were presented by Tiwani, a London and African based gallery, which showed at Art Basel Miami Beach. As the Art Basel &amp; UBS report indicates, the US claims the largest market share of the global art market, as such UK and African based galleries are constantly looking at connecting to collectors in that country. Courtesy Art Basel, © Art Basel In a graph analysing which country has the largest market share no African countries are listed. As has been the case for some time, the US claims the lion&apos;s share of the art market at 43%, China 20% and the UK 17%. Substantiating the idea that Brexit has had a negative impact on the British market paving way for the French to lead in Europe, it was found that the UK has been losing ground – 3% year on year – and the French market gained a percentage point. What do all these figures mean for the African art market or collectors focussed on African art or based in Africa? London has been the most active pan-African centre for the trading of African art – with buyers and sellers from Africa and elsewhere gravitating towards this British capital to acquire or sell art. This seems unlikely to change immediately, but these figures suggest, that in time Paris might surpass London. Many dealers and collectors from former French colonies in Africa have maintained links to France but those with links to Britain may need to start looking to Paris. Given the US and China claim the largest share of the art market, does suggest that collectors and dealers focussing on Europe should be turning their attention to these continents as places to sell art. This naturally, pertains to those works produced by African artists who have established reputations on those continents. It is the first time data on NFTs have been included and analysed in this annual report, albeit separately from the regular art and antique market. The findings on this market suggest it remains separate from the ‘conventional’ art market in the sense that sales of NFTs at auction houses, art fairs, and by art dealers remain fairly low. Yet the turnover and growth are so substantial, particularly during a time when the traditional art market has battled during the pandemic, that this form of digital art simply can’t be ignored. Yinka Shonibare CBE shows his work at James Cohan Gallery at Art Basel Miami Beach. As the Art Basel &amp; UBS report indicates, the US claims the largest market share of the global art market. Courtesy Art Basel, © Art Basel In 2019 sales of NFTs were estimated at $4,6million and in 2021 they grew to $11 billion. Significantly, McAndrew makes a distinction between ordinary NFTs, collectible ones and art ones – as such these figures include music and sport NFTs. Notably, the sale of art NFTs accounts for a small fraction being sold in 2019, as such the NFT boom relates more to other types of NFTs. However, the sale of art NFTs has risen from 2% in 2019 to 24% in 2020, suggesting the pandemic accelerated sales of this category. In 2021 this figure, however, shrunk to 14% - is this due to the regular art market going live again? The number of buyers for art NFTs appears to have increased and there is an overlap between High Net Worth traditional art collectors and NFT buyers as it was found that 74% of these individuals acquired art-based NFTs in 2021. The average price for NFTs is rising, where once the average price was $200 in 2019, in 2021 it has risen to $1462. Significantly, a characteristic of the art NFT market is the potential for resale – resales made up 73% of the value of trading in art-related NFTs. This may all bode well for those interested in NFTs or contemplating investing in this market – which like all others would require research before leaping in. However, as with all new markets, particularly related to cryptocurrency – it is a volatile market with a number of issues disrupting its long-term stability. Largely this is due to an absence of tight regulations which have allowed for fraudulent copies of artists&apos; work to be flooding the market. The anonymity of the buyers and sellers in market places makes this class of art highly vulnerable to “transactions that would not be permitted in other financial markets.” For example, creators have been found to be buying and reselling their own work in an attempt to drive up its price. However, to the NFT art market’s credit the “transparency of blockchain data makes it easy to discover these activities and identify sources” argues McAndrew. The resale market for traditional art objects remains stable and it was found to have rebounded strongly in 2021 increasing by 47% from 2020. In line with previous studies, Postwar and Contemporary art claims the market share of the auction market in terms of value and number of lots. In other words, contemporary art remains the most buoyant, which is not surprising when you consider that they found that on average High Net Worth (HNW) collectors spent over $1million on art and antiques in 2021. This is extraordinary given that on average collections included 34 works in total. Given 37% of the HNW collectors were found to have engaged in extensive research before acquiring a work you could surmise that these small collections are fairly well-considered with larger sums spent on less risky works. In their survey, they found that HNW collectors are concerned with the value of works holding (76%) though it is significant that 7% or less bought art for investment reasons.

Artists spend a few weeks working in the space with printer Georgina Berens who facilitates the technical side of the printmaking process from start to finish. Once signed by the artist, the prints are documented and published by South Atlantic Press. Prints are available for sale online and can be shipped worldwide. The studio is a space that is primed for collaboration and experimentation, constantly changing to accommodate and support the artist in residence. All woodcuts, linocuts, etchings and monotypes published by South Atlantic Press are professionally printed by hand. South Atlantic Press is committed to making quality limited-edition fine art prints that are archival, discussing the value of print and supporting the printmaking community. Instagram | Website Artists in the Studio Mia Chaplin &quot;I have currently been producing a body of work consisting of large oil paintings and time-consuming sculptures, so making this series of monotypes was a welcome relief for me. I find the process exciting as I feel less in control of the outcome of each piece and there is a bit of a mystery as to how the colours and textures on the plate will relate to the paper. This makes the process feel less precious, giving me the space to be a bit more experimental with colour and form.&quot; &quot;I love the theatrical reveal of the paper being peeled away from the plate after coming off the press and then watching as the colours change and finally settle on the drying print. The resulting image is a record of an unwound process of making a picture and then letting it go.&quot; – Mia Chaplin, 2022 Mia Chaplin working in South Atlantic Press studio &amp; Mia Chaplin, detail of Found and Lost it Again, 2022, Monotype on Zerkall.

Much about the happenings that have led us to today’s South Africa are hidden or distorted. The more we meditate on the possibilities of social and spiritual redress, the more we need to question the intricate realities of tribal migration, as well as the spatial and cultural dispossessions that have shaped our country. As arduous as the journey to unearth how we got here is, we must proceed with intention. At a 14-day artist residency named Bodyland, where the occupants engaged with the socio-political make-up of the Ciskei – the centre of the Cape Frontier Wars – Makoba encountered heritage sites such as The Burial Place of Ntsikana and Fort Armstrong (the site for a pivotal tension during the eighth frontier war, when forces led by Chief Maqoma and Kona overthrew the British). “I was surprised to have never heard of any of the places we visited, despite being from the space. What threw me off even more is how dilapidated all of the monuments are, you’d never say they hold so much history,” said Makoba. It is one thing to memorialise the lives that were lost. It is another more challenging prospect to value the lives that remain in the resistance. Makoba’s rendering of history hidden in plain sight is a poignant prompt to empathise with how one’s culture comes to be. “On a drive to King Williams Town, my parents were recalling stories about the Bhisho Massacre and with every death or detail my mom remembered, she would exclaim ‘uyafihla mhlaba!’” - text by Jabulile Dlamini-Qwesha Yonela Makoba, holding up a test print for the work Uyafihla Mhlaba, 2021, woodcut with chine-collé, R 25,500.00 ex.

      <title>&quot;Into the Light&quot; – A Look at South Africa&apos;s National Pavilion for the 59th Venice Biennale</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/into-the-light-a-look-at-south-africas-national-pavilion-for-the-59th-venice-biennale</link>
      <description>&quot;Into the Light&quot; A Look at South Africa&apos;s National Pavilion for the 59th Venice Biennale ----------------------------------------------------------------- Roger Ballen, 25 monochromatic images displayed on light boxes The South African Pavilion presents the works of Phumulani Ntuli, Lebohang Kganye and Roger Ballen in its theme, Into the Light . This poignant premise hones the focus of ‘The Milk of Dreams’—the richness of artistic expression unlocked by delving into the realm of fantasy and imagination— by placing it in the context of the pandemic lockdowns and quarantines. While many found the enforced isolation debilitating, some recognised it as an opportunity for creative introspection, in which they emerged from a state of being “in the dark” to one of illumination and insight through excavation of the psyche and imagination. All the artworks presented, in tandem with the design of this exhibition, are artefacts of this revelatory journey within their creators. In turn, we wish for them to act as inspiration for the viewer to undertake their own journey into the light — to recognise solitude as an opportunity for heightened personal understanding instead of a cause for melancholy and despair. The works presented by the South African pavilion achieve this enlightenment through their power for intimacy: they offer an experience of both seeing and being seen. As they invite us into the private, shrouded, and mysterious worlds of their creators, they deepen both our knowledge of the other, and of the self. In so doing, they facilitating meaningful cross-cultural bonding so pertinent in our country’s heritage. As we enter into a room of dimness, Godide , the character of Ntuli’s oceanic stop-motion sheds his African attire before departure, leading his audience to embark on their own quest for self-exploration and construction. Then, in a soft, hypnotising haze, Kganye welcomes us into her childhood, township home; beckons us to join in the dismantling of myth and memory whilst she relives and playacts the Western folklores ingrained in her childhood consciousness. Ballen’s backlit apparitions that hang from the ceiling — a mystical night sky — transport us to the primal roots of our mental subconscious where absurd primordial scenes from the afterworld are deeply embedded. Lebohang Kganye, Venice Biennale 2022 Within these narrowing zones of &apos;wandering&apos; and &apos;wondering&apos;, the design of the exhibition aims to represent and elicit a surfacing of illuminating personal truths. Photography and film are mediums intrinsically dependent on light: the images in these works are magical “emanations” of the original scenes that they represent. This is profound because the photo-theatrical realms of these South African works open our eyes and give us ‘vision’. They toy with restrictive identities, ideals, fantasies and myths and offer us a lens into the progressive landscape of South African art. Into the Light addresses the challenges that the pandemic has inflicted upon society and hopes to foster global dialogue about our individual and collective experiences during this time and how we move forward — together — into a new, unforeseen world. It has certainly done so for me. Such is the “milk” of dreams. Phumulani Ntuli, Venice Biennale 2022 South Africa is renowned as a land of great scenic beauty, mineral wealth, biodiversity, and a troubled history of conflict and oppression. The nation has emerged as a young democracy whose diverse peoples have endured adversity with robust stoicism, keenly aware that the times of deepest despair can also give rise to the greatest and most uplifting advances. Like all other nations, South Africa has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary countermeasures to combat the spread and effects of the virus. The arts sector, dependent on audience gatherings and comprised mainly of individuals and small companies rather than corporate entities, was devastated. South Africa’s national exhibition for the 59 th Venice Biennale builds on the premise that as ruinous as the pandemic has been at individual, national and global level, adversity can also bring creative opportunity. More on the artists Phumulani Ntuli Phumulani Ntuli is a multidisciplinary artist who describes his work as based around fictional geographies, simulation, archive and representation. He explores these concerns through a collision between documentary and fiction using collages, performance and stop-motion video animation. For Ntuli, the journey of self-investigation lies in the exploration of the psyche. These ideas define each other rather than being mutually exclusive: the real is underpinned by fantasy, and the fantasy is given depth by reality. Human beings are an amalgamation: a beautiful, complex tapestry of these kinds of contradictions – and only in blending seemingly opposite ideas can there be any harmony with, or revealing of, the self. His works blend reality, fantasy, science fiction, the dystopia of our past and the dream of a hopeful Black future. Observers have described his work as dreamlike, or perhaps nightmarish. Phumulani Ntuli with his work at the Venice Biennale Ntuli’s exhibits will feature an eclectic mix of stop-motion animation videos and collages on canvas, created in the period from 2020-2022. A centrepiece will be his stop-motion animation film Godide , in which Ntuli presents himself as an intrepid explorer, symbolically shedding his traditional African attire (and thereby his African identity) before diving below paper cut-out waves to enter an imaginary realm in which he explores the vast geopolitical diversity of identities, cultures and states of being. Ntuli’s exhibition consists of three short, animated films displayed on video screens, and four collage transfers on canvas, viewed via an Augmented Reality app on an iPad. People engaging with Phumulani Ntuli&apos;s augmented reality piece at the Venice Biennale Lebohang Kganye Lebohang Kganye is a 31 year old Johannesburg-based visual artist who uses photography, theatre, animation, cuttings and installations/sculpture to realise her artistic vision. Kganye’s art is often autobiographical, focusing on her heritage and childhood. She portrays her own family stories handed down from generation to generation, but visually rather than by traditional word of mouth. Western fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, along with the enduringly popular film adaptations of these literary works by Disney, evoke a strong sense of nostalgia within Kganye. She vividly recalls yearning to be cast as the titular Snow White in annual school plays. Lebohang Kganye with her work at the Venice Biennale Her exhibits for the Venice Biennale will be drawn from her 2011 photographic print collection B(l)ack to Fairy Tales. For this collection, she reimagines and portrays herself as Snow Black in staged cameos from the fairy tales she loved as a child, but set in an African township. Kganye was struck by the pervasive influence of Western fairy tale mythology, its romantic ‘happily ever after’ ethos constantly at odds with the grim poverty of the townships where she grew up. Her art questions the educative influence of Western fairy tales as they spread to other cultures and contexts around the globe. She infuses her images with a surrealist, dream-like quality to stand as a warning against the filtering effects that mythology can have on the psyche and the individual’s perception of reality. Through the uncomfortable juxtaposition of Western historical fiction with contemporary African reality, mixing fictional and authentic characters, Kganye’s staged images offer a unique perspective on the dichotomy of our nation’s history and its political and economic struggles. The Lebohang Kganye exhibition consists of 14 photographic inkjet prints on cotton rag paper. Kganye concludes that the collection illustrates ‘the political in the personal’, how intimate personal narratives inter-relate and resonate with larger social and political issues. Roger Ballen In the 1970s, photographer and film-maker Roger Ballen emigrated from his native USA to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he now lives and works. Fascinated by the novel cultures, characters and sights of his new home, Ballen travelled the length and breadth of the country, documenting his experiences in a series of thematic photo collections. His inquisitiveness led Ballen to places, people and situations that most South Africans have never encountered. Ironically, it took the fresh perspective of an immigrant to help South Africans understand and appreciate the sheer scale and diversity of what the country offers. Roger Ballen with his work at the Venice Biennale The Roger Ballen exhibition will showcase images from his 2016 book The Theatre of the Apparitions . This project was inspired by Ballen observing the crude etchings which former inmates of an abandoned women’s prison had created by scraping off the paint used to blacken the windows of the facility. Ballen devised his own technique to simulate this style, coating glass with special paints to create a black ‘canvas’. Ballen then etches away the coating to create the image, backlights the glass and photographs it in black-and-white. The Theatre of the Apparitions transports the viewer into a spiritual fantasy realm of haunting images, in which fossilised facial forms and dismembered figures interact with ghostly shadow forms in bizarre rituals. It is a theatre of the macabre in which Ballen not only delves into the dark recesses of his own subconscious but invites the viewer to explore theirs. The Ballen exhibition will consist of 25 monochromatic images displayed on lightboxes. Ballen considers his camera lens to be an opening into the ‘dark chamber’ of his mind, and sees his photographs as mirrors, reflectors and connectors that challenge the mind. He expresses the hope that the images will help viewers to connect to their core selves, to link the parts of the mind that they keep separate, and to access spirits that live within us all.</description>

      <title>FEATURE: On K Sello Duiker, Damien Hirst, and Mountain Retreats</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/feature-on-k-sello-duiker-damien-hirst-and-mountain-retreats</link>
      <description>My dog and I are in ‘K Sello’ (Duiker), my daughter next door in ‘Herman’ (Charles Bosman). We’re at McBains in Bainskloof, a mountain retreat co-owned by Justin Nurse and Ma’ayan Hamiltion. He — K Sello — is a long-lost, long-dead friend and author of the most significant South African novel of the last 30 years, The Quiet Violence of Dreams. Pre-woke, Duiker’s novel has an honesty few comprehend today. He saw the rise of ‘neo-black’ fascism and wrote the dirt on our pathological inheritance in a prose that is alive to a human perversity which most these days suppress, or worse, ‘cancel’. Revisionism is the new norm; the art world aglow with nuclear green sanctimony. Not something that Duiker would have approved of, well, not the desperate-contrite-faux sheen of care which generally accompanies the heist at least.</description>

      <title>Folly, Frailty and Fear | A Virtual Walkabout with Diane Victor</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/folly-frailty-and-fear-a-virtual-walkabout-with-diane-victor</link>
      <description>Folly, Frailty and Fear | A Virtual Walkabout with Diane Victor Diane Victor Folly from Latitudes Online on Vimeo . Renowned South African artist Diane Victor ’s latest solo exhibition opens at UJ Art Gallery on the 14th of April 2021 with a live-streamed virtual walkabout with the artist at 6pm on the gallery’s Facebook page . Though a result of Covid-19 restrictions, the event will be a fortuitous opportunity for those outside of Johannesburg and around the world to join this rare occasion and pose questions to the artist. The seed for Folly, Frailty and Fear was planted for Diane Victor while reading Desiderius Erasmus’ text In Praise of Folly (1511) where the writer uses satire and social critique in the guise of humour to parody power. In those times the powers he pointed a finger at were religious. In Victor’s case, her works look instead to current times; to corruption, violence and fear. The show constitutes various bodies of work. In Praise of Folly follows Erasmus’ original characters Dame Folly and Master Fool as they enact various scenarios inspired by, as Victor told Latitudes, “the infatuation that seems to infiltrate our society, the need for flattery through one’s postings and one’s likes and dislikes on social media, and the folly of attempting to rewrite histories that cannot be changed.” The Chalkboard series is another body of work within the show. Rendered in chalk on blackboards, the works depict the lessons that our society never seems to have learned, the misjudgements and miscalculations we continue to make. The bodies of work in the exhibition are produced in a variety of mediums and experimental materials: tapestry, lithographs, the smoke drawings Victor is well-known for and drawings made on stone. Victor’s interest in exploring alternative processes is in part inspired by her years teaching; encouraging students to question their materials. In turn she’s inspired to question her own. Her smoke drawings which she began doing twenty years ago have migrated onto glass, accidentally producing shadow works when light is shone through it. The smoke drawings have also been printed on cloth producing works that are less fragile. Printed onto various surfaces inspires different readings of the works, although this isn’t necessarily Victor’s intention which is instead to play, experiment and stay open to a shift between mediums. “Different mediums give back in ways you don’t expect and it’s that unexpected potential that I try to use to move me out of my safe comfort zones,” she says. Working on stone is a new direction seen in this show. Victor uses sandstone polished down to a fine finish to draw on. “Working on the stones and drawing on the stones came from the visual seduction or the physical seduction of drawing on litho stones which is perhaps one of the most beautiful surfaces to actually draw on. I can fully understand why palaeolithic man drew on stone walls,” she says. Image: Diane Victor at Atelier le Grand Village Victor’s hopes for this show are what she hopes for any body of work she creates: to be a mirror for the society she is part of, reflecting back on itself laced with cynical humour. “I think I’m too cynical to labour under the illusion that an artwork can offer hope to the viewer,” she says. “I think a vaccine rollout programme that functioned would offer hope to a viewer, the return of monies leached from our society — millions stolen from the poorest people in the country, returned and some kind of prosecution port would inspire hope. A solution or attempted solution to the horrific attacks and murders of women in our society produces hope. An artwork presuming to do this would be a little grandiose. As a maker sometimes I think of myself as being a small seismograph that just attempts to measure the disruptions. If anything, an early warning system or an alarm bell that just gets stuck on in a society so well-skilled in, not necessarily indifference, but the ability to sublimate the things around them and just continue. Hopefully drawings offer that reflected world. Perhaps seeing it from a different angle you see a little bit more clearly for a short while.” Folly, Frailty and Fear will be on show at UJ Art Gallery from the 14th of April until the 19th of May 2021, and virtually on their digital platform Moving Cube until May 2022.

      <title>Top Ten Pavilions to See at the Venice Biennale</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/top-ten-pavilions-to-see-at-the-venice-biennale</link>
      <description>The Top Ten Pavilions to See in Venice ---------------------------- As tempted as one may be to see every national pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale, whether this be virtual or in the flesh, the chances of covering the Arsenale, Giardini and fringe spaces are reasonably slim. To help with narrowing down your list of must-see shows, we have enlisted the guidance of art advisor, Alexia Walker who recently returned home to Johannesburg after attending a white hot launch week in Venice. Alexia Walker grew up in Paris and holds a Master in contemporary art history from Université de La Sorbonne. Now based in Johannesburg, Alexia leads her art advisory Walker Art to help collectors build their collections. She has modern and contemporary art expertise with a special focus on Africa. Prior to establishing Walker Art, Alexia co-founded the art advisory Walker Scott and the art management start-up Capital Art. Here are Alexia&apos;s top 10 Pavilions to visit at this year&apos;s Venice Biennale: United States Of America Simone Leigh: Sovereignty Curator: Eva Respini, Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston Venue: Giardini Pavilion of UNITED STATE OF AMERICA, Simone Leigh: Sovereignty, 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams, Photo by: Marco Cappelletti, Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia Simone Leigh&apos;s &quot;Sovereignty&quot; is characterised by an interest in performativity and affect. Leigh’s expansive practice parses the construction of Black femme subjectivity. Her large-scale sculptural works join forms derived from vernacular architecture and the female body, rendering them via materials and processes associated with the artistic traditions of Africa and the African diaspora. &quot;Sovereignty&quot; commingles disparate histories and narratives, including those related to ritual performances of the Baga peoples in Guinea, early Black American material culture from the Edgefield District in South Carolina, and the landmark 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition. With a series of new bronzes and ceramics both outside and inside the Pavilion, Leigh intervenes imaginatively to fill gaps in the historical record by proposing new hybridities.

In line with her practice to date, Sedira uses autobiographical narrative, fiction and documentary to shed light on past and present international solidarities related to historical liberation struggles. Her contribution serves as a cautionary tale about the failure of an emancipatory promise which, for many people, remains an unfulfilled, not to say an impossible dream. In “Dreams Have No Titles”, the artist addresses a major turning point in the history of cultural, intellectual and avant-garde production of the 1960s, 1970s and beyond, in France, Italy and Algeria especially. She focuses on a repertoire of remarkable cinematographic co- productions and filmmaking, in particular activist ones, which had an impact on postcolonial movements. During several visits to the archives of the Algerian Cinémathèque, she continued to mine the country’s incredible film heritage, which hardly ever gets a mention in the history of the cinematographic avant-gardes. Post- independence cinema in France, Italy and Algeria adhered to the so-called “Third-World” values and aesthetics, which amounted to a true revolution on the big screen. Throughout her life, Zineb Sedira felt close to this militant and anti-colonial movement inspired by the Cuban model, showing a political courage that she considers to be an important manifestation of solidarity at that time, and which she hopes to reactivate today.

Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia British artist Sonia Boyce’s powerful exhibition explores the potential of collaborative play as a route to innovation. Boyce’s installation brings together video works featuring five Black* female musicians (Poppy Ajudha, Jacqui Dankworth MBE, Sofia Jernberg, Tanita Tikaram and composer Errollyn Wallen CBE) who were invited to improvise, interact and play with their voices. The video works take centre stage among Boyce’s signature tessellating wallpapers and golden geometric structures, and the Pavilion’s rooms are filled with sounds – sometimes harmonious, sometimes clashing – embodying feelings of freedom, power and vulnerability. This new commission expands on Boyce’s Devotional Collection, built over more than two decades and spanning more than three centuries, which honours the substantial contribution of Black British female musicians to transnational culture.

Photo: Daniel Rumiancew. Images courtesy Zachęta — National Gallery of Art For the first time in the over-120-year history of the International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia, a Roma artist is representing a national pavilion. The project Re-enchanting the World by Małgorzata Mirga-Tas, prepared specifically for the Polish Pavilion at the Biennale Arte 2022, is an attempt to find the place of the Roma community in European art history. Re-enchanting the World is Małgorzata Mirga-Tas’s manifesto on Roma identity and art, drawing inspiration from the astrological frescos of the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara. You are about to enter a ‘picture palace’, an installation of twelve large-format textiles, corresponding to the months of the calendar, which expands the history of art with representations of the culture of the Roma, the largest European minority.

Filming without interfering in the games, Alÿs reveals the hidden rules of playing, the ingenious interaction of the children with their environment, their deep complicity and their hopeful mood and joy. The installation in the Pavilion invites the visitor to walk through a labyrinth of screens as if they were in the middle of a global playground. The sound and image of the different films interact with each other, fragments forming together a whole, allegories translating the complexity of a sometimes harsh reality. A series of small paintings covering a period from 1994 to 2021 accompanies the video presentation providing the context in which some of the films were made. From Kabul to Ciudad Juárez, from Jerusalem to Shanghai, they unfold Alÿs’ distinct poetic sensibility towards social and political concerns. To learn more visit the Belgian Pavilion .

Fusinato performed live in the pavilion using an electric guitar as a signal generator into mass amplification to improvise slabs of noise, saturated feedback and discordant intensities that trigger a deluge of images. The resulting all-consuming experience is open for the audience to interpret and make sense of. Originally from the Veneto region in Italy, Marco Fusinato’s parents migrated to Australia where he was born. He currently lives and works in Naarm/Melbourne. Fusinato is a contemporary artist and noise-musician whose work takes the form of installation, photographic reproduction, design, performance and recording. DESASTRES is a culmination of his interests in noise/experimental music, underground culture, mass media images and art history. DESASTRES is a visceral experience of sound and image that places the audience at the centre of the work. Fusinato will perform live in the pavilion using an electric guitar as a signal generator into mass amplification to improvise slabs of noise, saturated feedback and discordant intensities that trigger a deluge of images. The resulting all-consuming experience is open for the audience to interpret and make sense of. To learn more visit the Australian Pavilion. Marco Fusinato, DESASTRES, 2022.

It is about constructing a more democratic and egalitarian reality moved by different technologies that do not partake in the productive machinery of capitalism, seeking to re-enchant a world that coloniality and modernity desecrated.

The title stands for the black star from Ghana flag, but also represent Africa’s connection with its diasporas through Marcus Garvey’s “Black Star Line” and his Back-to-Africa movement revived now in Ghana; as well as for Pan-Africanism and anti-colonialism with the symbol described as the “Lodestar of African Freedom”. The Ghana pavilion, with the contribution of architect DK Osseo-Asare, explores the concept of this freedom across time and borders. The exhibition is based on curator Nana Oforiatta Ayim’s concept of the “Mobile Museum”, which travels into communities across Ghana in co-curation and exchange, with the aim of creating accessible, contextual, inclusive spaces. Na Chainkua Reindorf creates her own mythology of Mawu Nyonu, a fictional secret society made of seven women. Afroscope explore the concept on “oneness” – being one – with “Ashe”, a work based on a spirit that runs through all the elements using technology as a translator of the flow of life. Diego Araúja presents “A Congress of Salt“, in which the Atlantic Ocean, that served to separate those taken from the shores of West Africa to its diasporas, now acts as a unifier, the birthplace of a new creole.

Eleven of the works were shot on location in Sāmoa, from rural villages to churches, plantations and heritage sites, with a local cast and crew of over eighty people. Kihara’s performative photography upcycles select paintings by post-impressionist French artist Paul Gauguin in a suite of images that repurpose his paintings created during his time in the Islands of Tahiti and the Marquesas between 1891 and 1903. Kihara problematises Gauguin’s outsized legacy by re-enacting his paintings back in the Pacific, paying careful attention to the details of his works. These re-enactments instill a Polynesian inflection to each photograph and are based on strong personal relationships with Kihara’s sitters, all of whom are part of the Fa‘afafine and Fa‘atama communities. Kihara works with these models to represent her own vision of Paradise, redirecting the viewer to the concerns of contemporary Pacific Islanders and ‘returning the gaze’ in a profound gesture of empowerment. In one photograph within the suite, Kihara casts herself as Gauguin in Paul Gauguin with a hat (After Gauguin). Through this ingenious role reversal, Kihara commands her own space within the traditions of art history while upending the conventions of portraiture itself.

Courtesy of the artist; National Gallery of Zimbabwe. &quot;I did not leave a sign?&quot; seeks to embrace different realms of knowledge and ways of knowing; recalling scientific and technical minds who rebelled against the cultic centres of faith, and brought in a new age through remembering how the twentieth-century disaster demonstrated that science and technology are not infallible, after all, and that modern faith in the objective ideal was an illusion. The osmosed worlds of reality and technology in the face of new technological innovations, juxtaposed with the ubiquity of mortality in the face of a Global Pandemic, are ever eviscerated through the exhibiting quartet’s expressions. The exhibition will have highly amphibious perspectives; tales of the dispersion, migration and the animated livelihood of being Zimbabwean while governed by invisible threats take center stage in this exposition. — Fadzai Veronica Muchemwa, Curator Learn more about the Zimbabwean Pavilion .

      <title>Did African curators miss the gondola at Venice?</title>

      <description>Did African curators miss the gondola at Venice? ---------------------------- Pavilion of UNITED STATE OF AMERICA , Simone Leigh: Sovereignty, 59 th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia Black female artists triumphed at the 59th Venice Biennale. This should have bode well for Africa’s artists, and expression, yet none of Africa’s pavilions were dedicated to a female artist. The 59th Venice Biennale will be remembered as the culmination of widespread institutional acknowledgement of female artists, and especially black female artists. Largely, this manifested through the main exhibition curated by Cecilia Alemani, titled The Milk of Dreams , which is inspired by the British female surrealist, Leonora Carrington. In this vein, overlooked female artists from the past or periphery are featured heavily - it has been observed that almost half of the 213 artists in the exhibition are no longer living. The female-centric vibe was reiterated through the Golden Lion Awards, announced over the weekend with; Great Britain winning best national participation with a solo presentation of works by Sonia Boyce, a special mention for France’s pavilion which was dedicated to the work of Zineb Sedira, a French Algerian, Simone Leigh named the best participant and special mentions for two other female artists, Lynn Hershman Leeson from the US and Shuvinai Ashoona from Nunavut. The Golden Lion Lifetime achievement awards went to two female artists Katherina Frisch, who represented Germany and Cecilia Vicuña the Chilean artist. Pavilion of UGANDA, Radiance: They dream In Time, 59 th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams, Photo by: Andrea Avezzù, Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia Reading the moment, which has been building globally, via major institutions dedicating their programming to shining the light on female artists, many of the curators of the national pavilions isolated a female artist, often of colour, from their country to represent it at the Venice Biennale. Interestingly, none of the African pavilions were dedicated to a single artist, nor a female one. A number of the African pavilions were steered by female curators but almost all, except for Kenya and Uganda’s pavilions, which were split between male and female artists, were dominated by male artists. That would be pavilions presented by South Africa, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Zimbabwe. Pavilion of SOUTH AFRICA, Into the Light, 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams , Photo by Andrea Avezzù. Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia As such feminist thematics – typically tied to the body, which based on reports featured heavily – didn’t dominate the African pavilions. Perhaps African cultural expression remains under a patriarchal thumb? Or are African countries less compelled to appear to be towing a feminist line than European ones? Is the Venice Biennale just a space for nations to appear to be ‘correcting’ socio-political biases they can’t resolve? Certainly, there is no shortage of talented African women artists on - and off the continent. South Africa’s Marlene Dumas was the focus of a major exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi and by all reports, this show has been one of the strongest shows outside of the Biennale. What accounts for this glaring absence and perhaps the lack of confidence in advancing one female artist to represent an African pavilion. You could argue that a solo presentation is more likely to have an impact as it tends to allow visitors to fully appreciate the artist’s practice but also gives the artist the space to conceptualise an all-encompassing presentation – a sustained dialogue if you will. Cecilia Alemani , 59 th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams, Photo by Andrea Avezzù, Courtesy La Biennale di Venezia Despite this Uganda’s pavilion received a special mention in the award ceremony. It was curated by Shaheen Merali, and included the work of Acaye Kerunen (a female artist) and Collin Sekajugo. Interestingly, an African aesthetic took centre stage at the 59th Venice Biennale via the heightened interest in Simone Leigh’s towering architectonic sculptures included in Alemani’s rambling exhibition and via the works she produced for the US pavilion. Pavilion of UNITED STATE OF AMERICA, Simone Leigh: Sovereignty, 59 th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams, Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia Leigh’s bronze Brick House , a 2019 sculpture, presenting a black woman whose torso is a fusion of a skirt and a clay house, dominated Instagram feeds the moment this monumental art event opened. To New Yorkers this figure might have been a familiar sight, as it was originally commissioned as an outdoor public sculpture for a busy artery, the High Line, where it would compete with towering buildings in that city. As such this 16-foot sculpture was designed to stand out in a busy urban landscape. The other works Leigh produced for the US pavilion appear (based on images) to be equally commanding playing off and in dialogue with the interior and exterior of the building. Naturally, the monumental scale and slick execution of Leigh’s sculptures contributed towards the popularity of her work but they are also symbolic of a wider socio-political reordering in which black women are taking centre stage. Pavilion of SOUTH AFRICA, Into the Light, 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams , Photo by Andrea Avezzù. Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia As such the celebration of Leigh’s practice at this important international art event should bode well for the African art world, particularly given that her aesthetic is said to be rooted in African classical art and architectural typologies. For example, the raffia-topped façade and wooden columns, layered over the palladium style Italian edifice, which Leigh has employed at the US pavilion, are intended to evoke the Cameroon-Togo Pavilion at the International Colonial Exhibition which took place in Paris in the early 30s. As such she adopts a concern popular among African contemporary artists; the objectification of African culture through the colonial gaze. In a recent interview with Leigh for The New York Times , she suggested that she found artistic and intellectual kinship in South African artists that included Dineo Seshee Bopape, Kemang Wa Lehulere and Nicholas Hlobo. Simone Leigh, Golden Lion for the Best Participant 1763, 59 th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, The Milk of Dreams, Photo by Andrea Avezzù, Courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia In this way, you could say that African art, history and aesthetics are at the centre of this year’s 59th Venice Biennale, but curiously it manifested vicariously via an American artist and pavilion. Are such themes and aesthetics more likely to be prized if they are channelled through an American than an African? It is a pity that no female African artists were championed at any of the national pavilions and given the room and perhaps the resources to fly above the radar. Might this have also been related to bureaucratic bungling? The team for South Africa’s pavilion was only announced in January this year, which would have left little time to create and ship ‘monumental’ works to Italy in time. Some memorable works by African artists, fortunately, did make it to the 59th Venice Biennale in time. Large scale works by South African artists Igshaan Adams and Bronwyn Katz were included in Alemani’s exhibition, which also featured what appears to be an incredible installation work made of stones, dirt and sugarcane by Precious Okoyomon (from Nigeria) titled To See the Earth before the End of the World (2022). Sandra Mujinga, born in the DRC, also turned heads with her installation sculpture Sentinels of Change.

      <title>K.Skit’s Three Balloons Embraces the Gift of Life Beyond Trauma</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/k-skit-s-three-balloons-embraces-the-gift-of-life-beyond-trauma</link>
      <description>K.Skit’s Three Balloons Embraces the Gift of Life Beyond Trauma The self-taught artist’s multimedia series uses balloons to convey the quest for joy and freedom in the midst of struggle, writes Sandiso Ngubane With balloons on his head, K.Skit explores how Black people often find healing and joy in spite of the generational and ongoing trauma inherited from historical oppression. In Paris is Burning , the 1990 film chronicling the New York City ball culture, one of its subjects speaks on being Black and gay in America. ”I remember my dad telling me you have three strikes against you in this world,” he says. “Every Black man has two – being Black and being a man. You are Black, you’re a man and you’re gay. If you’re going to do this, you’re going to have to be stronger than you have ever imagined.” It’s no different for queer Black men everywhere. Escaping the reality of what you’re up against in the world – specifically racism and homophobia – sometimes means conducting yourself in a way that makes you more ‘palatable’, as artist K.Skits puts it. The 20-year-old from Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, recently debuted a body of work titled The Three Balloons under the auspices of Bubblegum Club’s Bubblegum Invites incubator. The initiative was established by the youth culture journal to support emerging artists by providing them with studio space and the resources necessary to bring their work to life. Born Kgotlelelo Bradley Sekiti, K.Skit’s series explores the “the generational and ongoing traumas of Black bodies; the everyday experiences of queer Black bodies and (the) Black body’s ability to embrace the gift of life through celebration”. K.Skits wears an afro symbolising blackness and a white shirt as commentary on the sanitisation of blackness he says artists are often cornered into by the palatability requirements of the white gaze. “My experience as a Black and queer person; there’s a lot of trauma but somehow, even with that trauma we are able to find reasons to celebrate. That’s what the balloons are about,” he explains. “It’s a symbol of celebration. Black people are incredible artists. This is how we find joy and healing. We share that with the world but beyond that, this work is about reclaiming my identity.” The artist adds that too often Black artists are forced into a space where they have to ‘perform blackness’ for the white gaze. “What we do has to be palatable. You have to think about how to be Black and acceptable at the same time because we exist in a world that doesn’t like us. For me, this is about being unapologetically Black without having to put on a performance of what that is for someone else.” In the accompanying images, some shot on green screen rendered as a red background, K.Skits wears balloons covering his face. In others he wears an afro as a representation of blackness. “There are images where I’m wearing all-white; looking clean. That’s about the palatability we’re forced into but this also interacts with my queer experience so I’m half naked. Often, as queer Black men we are seen as meat. If we’re not being sexualised, we are kept around for clout or we constantly have to educate. In one way or another, we’re being taken from or our culture is being appropriated and exploited. The beans (in the one painting) symbolise the fact that some see blackness as a product you can get off the shelf. You choose how to consume that product whichever way you like.” The artists contends that in art blackness is often packaged in stereotypes that confirm biases rather than allowing Black people to freely express themselves The Three Balloons comes at a time when the news cycle is filled with reports of hate crimes perpetrated against Black gay men all over South Africa. Sphamandla Khoza, a 24 year old, was stabbed to death in Ntuzumu near Durban, and his body was found in a ditch near his home; in the Eastern Cape, Andile “Lulu” Nthulela, 40, disappeared for a week before his body was found buried at the home of a suspect; in Gauteng, Nathaniel Spokane’s body was found lifeless, with stab wounds in the chest. Reports say these are just three of many such cases, with at least one being reported every month for the last year. It’s clear that in spite of the country’s celebrated recognition of queer rights as espoused in the Constitution, the reality on the ground for most queer Black men remains bleak at best. It’s difficult to look at K.Skit’s work outside of this context. In ‘Mmele’ one of the videos from the series, K.Skits can be seen vogueing - a type of dance that is synonymous with New York City’s ball culture as seen in Paris is Burning . ‘Mmele’ means body in the artist’s native Sepedi language and the vogueing, drawn straight out of Paris is Burning , is characterised by hand gestures and body movements the artist sees as an apt depiction of liberation and the conjuring of alternative universes where his emancipation is not tethered to any particular gaze outside of his own. The queer ball scene informing K.Skit’s ideas around liberation has become popular around the world as an outlet for queer youth in their quest for ‘safe spaces’ within which to express their queerness outside of the hetero-patriarchal norms of modern society. They often dress in drag and participate in dance-offs for a predominantly queer audience as a way of escaping the norms that often render their identity and expressions undesirable – or unpalatable. As the artist notes, the rejection of queerness within Black communities and society at large, not only makes it difficult for many to exist without fear, it strips one of identity and often leaves queer youths to find alternative communities and ways of celebrating who they are. “Traditional dancing is not my experience and a lot of Black sub-cultures are not relevant to my experience,” the artist says of their decision to use vogueing as an expression of that identity rather than, say, a traditional African dance or minno was setšo (indigenous African music). “When I was in high school, I discovered Paris is Burning and I binged it for a week because I identified with that desire for free expression. I took from it how free people in the film were when they were on the ballroom floor but I also just like viewing the world as a stage. You can create an alternative universe of your own through art and performance.” The work Outrage by K.Skit touches on the manner in which ‘blackness’ is packaged and consumed and made palatable for the white gaze. A self-taught artist, K.Skits has been dancing as early as eight years old. After a few years of doing sports in school, he eventually joined the drummies – or drum majorettes – and continued to dance through high school. After matriculating and finding an internship doing social media at Wits University, K.Skit’s became interested in photography and began to experiment with self-portraiture and making short dance videos on his smartphone. The Three Balloons marks a continued expansion of this expression. He adds of his interest in art and ever developing multi-disciplinary practice that also includes DJ’ing: “Art feels to me like something that gives me room to express and create universes that don’t exist. It allows me to communicate in a different way, on my own terms and to create a different version of myself.” - African Art Features Agency funded by the National Arts Council of South Africa.</description>

      <description>Good collections pivot on critical conversations ---------------------------- Mary Sibande’s Turn, Turn, Turn, Turn, 2019 was included in the SMAC gallery exhibition, Black Luminosity. Photography has been an essential part of Sibande’s practice, though the artist has more recently focused on sculptures and installations. Image courtesy: SMAC Gallery Artists seem to be currently less interested in producing photographic works, but for collectors they present an opportunity to access a wealth of the visual history of the African continent Painting might be the medium du jour for African artists, particularly given the portraiture genre is experiencing a revival, however, photography has been one of the most important in not only the development of African expression but in an ongoing dialogue around identity, race and the western or white gaze. This link is perhaps so firm in our consciousness due to the late, great Nigerian curator, Okwui Enwezor, who curated a string of high-profile exhibitions in New York since the mid-1990s, which were dedicated to the work of African photographers. Think In/Sight: African Photographers 1940 to the Present (1996) which showed at the Guggenheim Museum; The Short Century: Independence and liberation movements in Africa, 1945-1994 , which was shown at the Museum Villa Stuck, Munich, the Martin-Gropius Bau, Berlin, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and P.S.1, New York (2001-2002); and Snap Judgements (2006) at the International Centre for Photography. Malick Sidibé, Portrait, Fanta Samaké, 1982. The Malian photographer is one of the most celebrated and the first photographer to be awarded a Golden Lion Award at the Venice Biennale. As such his works are highly coveted and fetch high sums at auction. This work was offered by Sotheby’s Africa Modern and Contemporary department at an auction last year You could draw a connection between the current fixation artists have with portraiture and its power to celebrate identity and the history of photography in Africa, which is thought to have flourished in countries post-independence. This coincided with the need to remake identities and reclaim suppressed histories and cultures. Think of the portraits produced by the Malian, Seydou Keïta, James Barnor in Ghana from the 1950s, Salla Casset or Meissa Gaya in Senegal in the 1940s, Malick Sidibe, the first photographer to win the Golden Lion award at the Venice Biennale, or J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere who documented women’s hairstyles in Nigeria in the 1970s. When Enwezor first arrived in the United States in 1992, he says he “noticed the absence of any sense of recognition of the kind of social space from which I came. Coming to the United States from Nigeria to begin a new one also was met with a total lack of any kind of historical presence of the immediate post-colonial period.” Zanele Muholi, Sasa, Bleecker, New York, 2016. This work was offered by Africa Modern and Contemporary department at auction last year. The secondary market for Muholi’s images remains strong In other words, it was through photographic works that Enwezor could best relay the postcolonial reality in the west. Given photographs are expected to relay the ‘truth’ it makes sense that this documentary mode carried weight with regards to upturning deep-seated biases about Africa that stretched back to ethnographer&apos;s use of photography to objectify African bodies and customs. Of course, it wouldn’t be long before artists were remaking their realities through the photographic medium. Enwezor would not be the only African curator interested in photography, with its links to memory, nostalgia, and documenting, challenging gender it has proved pivotal to most of the continent’s high-profile curators and as such has had discursive value in presenting contemporary expression from Africa at an international and local level. In A Decade of Curating (2007 to 2017) Corrigall &amp; Co undertook a dry study of the exhibitions staged by Africa’s most well-known curators and found that the majority of artists selected for the over 106 exhibitions produced on and off the continent over this decade long period, primarily worked with photography. Artists such as Zanele Muholi, George Osodi, Kudzanai Chiurai, Guy Tillim, Aida Muluneh, Mikhail Subotzky, Kiluanji kia Henda, Andrew Tshbangu, Sami Baloji, Andrew Esiebo, Mario Macilau, David Goldlbatt, Georges Senga, Lakin Ogunbanwo, Santu Mofokeng, Akintunde Akinleye, Mary Sibande and Ayana Jackson among many others, had their works consistently included in exhibitions curated by the likes of Simon Njami, Abedellah Karroum, Bonaventure Soh Bejeng and N’Gone Fall. Azu Nwagbogu, of course, tops the list, given this Nigerian curator is the founder and director of the Lagos Photo Festival in that city. Interestingly, he claimed in an interview that “[M]y passion is not really about photography per se, it’s got more to do with a general interest in the way stories are told and emotion, energy, world views are transmitted through images, the subtle nuisances within each story. ” Photography isn’t only a vital form of expression for Africans. The existence of fairs dedicated to photographic works, such as Photo Paris and Photo London, which opens this week in that city, substantiates the vitality of this medium and its gravitational pull for different sorts of collectors. J.D. Okhai Ojeikere, Abebe, (Hairstyles). The late Nigerian photographer’s portraits focused on women’s hairstyles. This work was offered by Sotheby’s Africa Modern and Contemporary department at an auction last year Photographic works tend to be affordable, as they are editioned, paper works. That’s if you don’t have your eye on a Goldblatt or Muholi, which can sometimes sell at auction for up to R250 000. In this way, collectors can have access to works by well-known artists and important historical documents of events, places, and people. Owning an image of historical importance or one that captures the essence of a period becomes an invaluable one that stands the test of time. This is unlikely to be the case with many contemporary works. The secondary market for photographic works is perhaps a little sluggish locally, in South Africa. Aspire Art Auction house annually hold an auction dedicated to photography, which has yet to become the bun-fight it should be, given the array of imagery on offer each year. Auctions dedicated to African art in France tend to feature much of the portraiture produced by the West African photographers mentioned earlier. Indeed, for discerning collectors who acquire works before everyone else is interested, photographic works remain an attractive prospect. As photographic works are relatively &apos;affordable&apos; and vital to curatorial conversations about Africa, they form a large proportion of collections of museums in western art centres - particularly in the US, where Enwezor drew attention to the history and vitality of this kind of image-making. Surely, given the historical and discursive importance of photography, in time this will be a more valued market. Despite this, there is a sense that photography as a medium for expression for African artists has waned or has become passé – Subotzky, Muholi, Nandipha Mntambo, Athi-Patra Ruga and Tracey Rose, have all shifted their interests to other mediums or are exploring them with varying success. Yet a new generation of artists has also found new life and boundaries to explore ensuring its continuing relevance. This has largely been achieved by adopting photo collage or generating surreal mash-ups with digital tools. A prime example of this would be the work of Puleng Mongale – who sometimes employs sepia tones in her imagery, referencing archival images. Bodies composed through crude splicing of found images – somewhat recalling the work of Wangechi Mutu - is another approach embraced by artists such as Lunga Ntila, Neo Matloga, Dawit Abebe, Larry Amponsah and Ken Nwadiogbu. Puleng Mongale, The Cravings of a City Girl I, 2020 R 8,150.00 ex. VAT Image-saturated social media tools such as Instagram have perhaps forced artists to push the boundaries of photography. The South African-based photographer Roger Ballen, one of the artists showing at the South African Pavilion at the 59th Venice Biennale, once remarked that his macabre imagery was borne from an awareness that the wide access to photography compelled him to create images that no else would think of (or dare to) make. In African countries where homosexuality remains illegal, or where they are battling other socio or political issues, photographic works play an important role for the subjects in terms of claiming their identity or validating their existence. Take the work of M’hammed Kilito, the Moroccan documentary photographer, whose photographic essay Among You , presents subjects representing different youth subcultures in his native country. “People want to be seen and heard,” observed Kilito. This persistent link between photography and the visibility of marginalised people remains compelling and those collectors interested in registering their support to end oppression based on race, gender and sexuality, can do so through acquiring social documentary imagery. A focus on this role in photography, could make for a very meaningful collection and you wouldn’t have to splash out on a Muholi or Goldblatt, nor would you necessarily have to look into the archives from the apartheid era, though this could be rewarding. Many of the photographers from that era are not represented by galleries so their works would have to be acquired directly, which could lead to some interesting conversations. However, as many photographers from that era - and now to some degree - often produced discrete narratives or series, it is worth acquiring a few, as so often a single image doesn’t tell the full story. A suite of photographic images is also likely to have more value in the secondary market. However, there are so many different sub-strands of photography that could get a collector thoroughly obsessed such as images documenting performance art. This function has loomed large at two survey exhibitions at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art in Cape Town dedicated to the work of Senzeni Marasela and Tracey Rose. Without a camera, these two artists would not have had much of an audience. Zanele Muholi, Isililo XX, 2014 The blurred line between fashion photography and art could also present another collecting strand worth pursuing. At last year’s Photo London there were some works by African artists working with photography that met this bill – such as images by Thandiwe Muriu and David Uzochukwu. Bright pop colours seem to define this sort of photographic practice, which in some ways seems to play to expectations of an African aesthetic. Perhaps the bright colours, flat patterns and pop vibe are a refreshing counterbalance to the heavy black white images of impoverished, overpopulated, African city scenes that continue to circulate in the West. - Mary Corrigall is a Cape Town based art advisor, journalist and independent researcher</description>

      <title>The Nature of NIROX Artist Residency</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/the-nature-of-nirox-artist-residency</link>
      <description>The Nature of NIROX Artist Residency “It’s a place where art happens.” A 2015 study in Denmark found a link between nature and creative thinking; that nature plays a role especially in the preparation and incubation phase of the creative process. But it doesn’t take a study to know the sprawling natural wonder of the NIROX Foundation is the perfect setting for an artist residency. According to Founder Benji Liebmann, it was “the ambiance of the property, its existing buildings and a commitment to make a difference through the arts” that prompted the conversation to invite artists to spend time there. Located in the Cradle of Humankind, west of Johannesburg, NIROX is best known for its Sculpture Park ; 30 hectares of cultivated lawns, arbors, fields, waterways and wetlands open on weekends and public holidays. It’s home to over 50 permanent and long-term installations by local and international artists. The Residency is an extension of this close relationship with artists from across the world who come to stay for usually 6 to 8 weeks. Beyond visual art, the Residency welcomes artists from across creative fields; musicians, dancers, theatre-makers or writers. Local musicians Msaki and Tubatsi Mpho Moloi recently completed a workshop residency with French cellist Clement Petit. Residents at NIROX are encouraged to interact and collaborate with each other to create compelling experiences. “My experience with NIROX has been so amazing and so educational because of all the artists I’ve had an opportunity to work with,” Moloi says. “Artists of all different disciplines, not only in music but sculptors, writers, dancers, poets. It’s been so advantageous for my career.” There are no rules to who can apply. “It’s an imperfect, natural, conversational process,” Liebmann says. “Mostly artists apply by writing to us, but we also approach them when there is a reason. Our network has grown organically.” This year, the Residency is host to Claudia Kubler and David Knuckey from Switzerland, Tawanda Takura from Zimbabwe and Sadie Clayton from the UK, among many others. Future residents are arriving from India, Angola and Germany. “Although the Residency is private, most artists are open to visits or conversations arranged through our curatorial staff”, Liebmann says. The public can attend occasional studio shows and open studios, news of which is published to the various Nirox online and social platforms. When they depart, each artist leaves a work of their choice for archival purposes. “The Foundation is not a collector,” Liebmann says, “It’s a place where art happens.” Every effort is made in ensuring artists have everything they need to create — from assistance with sourcing materials to various studio spaces to work from, a sculpture workshop and a screening room. Besides the grounds of the Foundation, artists in residence can access the adjoining 1000 hectare Khatlhaphi Private Nature Reserve and its diverse local game and birdlife. “It’s a wonderful space to be creative and to write from,” Moloi says. “It’s such an amazing and beautiful space.” The wide open space has inspired some breakthroughs. Artist Yolanda Mazwana stayed in February and besides taking on new concepts in her art, spent time visualising her future. “My residency at NIROX was simply aspirational for my next level of accomplishments, in seeing what else is out there, which I felt I needed not just in my art practice but also at the stage I am in my life,” she says. “There are no limits to how far life and art can take you. You just have to see the big picture and be assertive. I had a moment that felt like deja vu and I realized more than before I was on the right path.” Whether spending a morning in the Sculpture Park, an afternoon at a visiting artist’s open studio, or spending 6 weeks creating new material, it’s difficult to leave NIROX uninspired.

      <description>Where to See African Art Around the World Right Now ------------------------- VOLTA New York takes place from 18-22 May, and both Out of Africa Gallery and Ethan Cohen Gallery will be at the Fair, presenting works from the continent. Be sure not to miss it! Visiting New York? Get 50% off your tickets to the VOLTA NY Fair here ! VOLTA Art Fair fosters galleries in staging ambitious solo and group presentations, refining the experience to its essential elements: the artists and their work. Having fairs in both New York and Basel, this year Latitudes is proud to share that two exhibitors have a focus on African art: Out of Africa Gallery and Ethan Cohen Gallery. Out of Africa Gallery Barcelona, Spain / London, U.K Out of Africa Gallery (OOA) has selected two figurative Nigerian artists; in-demand artist Oluwole Omofemi (1988) and emerging artist Matthew Eguavoen (1988). Painted with oil and acrylic on canvas, Oluwole Omofemi’s black women, are depicted with dark, midnight hue skin, etched with deep tribal marks, and are crowned with engulfing halo-esque afros. Despite what on face value could appear to be a bleak outlook, Oluwole’s overarching mission is to showcase afrocentric pride, which he maintains can only truly be championed through how black women view themselves and in turn are viewed by others. Matthew addresses the impact of Slavery on the Africa and its people, the extinction of African traditional values and the growing sensation of religion in Africa, importation of western moral and cultural values to Africa and exiling Africa’s own cultural values as a people, with Africans abandoning Africa for relative greener pastures in western countries. Matthew Eguavoen, That is not enough reason, 2022, Acrylic and oil on canvas, 128 x 198 cm OOA Gallery was founded in 2011 and is located in the heart of Sitges; a stunning seaside resort, south of Barcelona, steeped in history and a rich culture. OOA Gallery champions contemporary African art, and work closely with an esteemed range of international artists, collectors, patrons, art fairs, and museums, spanning across Europe, North America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. OOA Gallery is committed to providing a unique platform for emerging and established artists to express their respective narratives, values and experiences through their artistic prowess, and to support them to explore, grow, and flourish in their practice. In the spirit of growth and exploration, the gallery now has a presence in the one of the major global art capitals, London and very soon in Paris too. OOA Gallery London, will extend the gallery’s reach, influence and name, and aid the gallery’s ambitious international programme and agenda. Oluwole Omofemi, Connection, 2022, Oil and acrylic on canvas, 150 x 120 cm Ethan Cohen Gallery New York / Beacon, USA For VOLTA New York 2022, Ethan Cohen Gallery is pleased to present Africa On My Mind , a group exhibition showcasing the works of four significant contemporary African artists. Africa On My Mind features works by Aboudia, Armand Boua, Frédéric Bruly Bouabré, and Innocent Nkurunziza. Aboudia, Armand Boua, and Frédéric Bruly Bouabré are participating in the Ivory Coast pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Contemporary African Art is at the forefront of artistic discourse today, and with its expansion into the global stage, there is growing attention to art coming out of the region. Historically overlooked, contemporary art coming out from the African continent now has finally pulled the attention of the global art community with top collections and institutions making it a priority to focus on, support, discover, and grow the dynamic art scene. With Africa On My Mind , Ethan Cohen Gallery offers an intimate look into what contemporary African artists are creating today. Armand Boua, Les Enfants de Cote D&apos;Ivoire, 2015, Tar and acrylic on board, 37 x 33 in Ethan Cohen Gallery has presented both emerging and internationally renowned artists for over 30 years. A groundbreaker in the field of contemporary Chinese art, it was the first gallery to present the Chinese Avant- Garde of the &apos;80s to the United States. The gallery occupies a distinct place in contemporary art as a center of innovation across disciplines and countries. It serves artists and clientele through international art fairs, curatorial projects with top institutions and as a center for seminal cultural events. Today Ethan Cohen Gallery has two gallery locations, Chelsea in the heart of New York City, and Beacon, New York. Ethan Cohen Gallery today represents a diverse mix of global contemporary art, with a continuing focus on emerging as well as established artists.

      <description>ODYSSEY Eclectica Contemporary presents Odyssey, an exhibition showcasing works from across the African continent. &quot;Our journey begins in North Africa. Here artists often work in contexts charged with multiple constraints. They can easily find themselves in war zones and regions fraught with conflict. These geographical discords give rise to deeper inner conflicts like a crossroads of tradition or political censorship. As a result North African artists either have to work in exile or exhibit in foreign countries. Ley Mborambwe FCC vs Cash (May the Lord be Glorified), 2020 Acrylic on canvas 130 x 130 The title Odyssey refers to a long and adventurous pilgrimage home after war, as the ancient Homeric Poem narrates. Our visual excursion begins in the magnetic North where the first documented history in Africa uproots and extends to southern counterparts. Odyssey explores dislocation, nostalgia and a romantic longing for past homelands, traditions and fading memories. It resembles an attempt to conjure up the past, and document memories and histories of the motherland.&quot; View Exhibition 3 May 2021 | Odyssey, An African Journey | Eclectica Contemporary | 56 Church Street, Cape Town , South Africa</description>

      <title>Atelier le Grand Village Unveils Bambo Sibiya&apos;s &apos;Dear Msakazi&apos;</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/atelier-le-grand-village-unveils-bambo-sibiyas-dear-msakazi</link>
      <description>Atelier le Grand Village Unveils Bambo Sibiya&apos;s &apos;Dear Msakazi&apos; ‘Dear Msakazi’ by Bambo Sibiya. Linogravure. Printed at Atelier le Grand Village. Edition 15. 84 x 122 cm. ORDER YOUR LIMITED EDITION TODAY Found in the Charente-Limousine in France, Atelier le Grand Village works to revive the rewarding art of stone lithography through close collaborations with visiting artists. Their latest piece, which premieres here on Latitudes, is a linocut artwork by South African artist Bambo Sibiya . The medium is familiar ground for Bambo, who worked on large scale linocuts for esteemed artists including William Kentridge, Diane Victor, Norman Catherine and Colbert Mashile while an artist in training in Johannesburg. It was a certain history of the city that inspired the subject matter he is most well-known for: the Swenkas. In apartheid South Africa, men journeyed from rural areas to the cities in search of work. There they&apos;d buy stylish suits to impress their families and neighbours on trips back home. A sub-culture evolved from these fashion statements and the Swenkas, as they became known, would battle for best outfit in lively competitions. In 2012, Bambo was awarded the prestigious Gerard Sekoto Award resulting in a residency at Atelier le Grand Village in 2013 where he met founder Francis van der Riet. It was the beginning of an ongoing collaboration. As Atelier le Grand Village presents the results of their latest undertaking, &apos;Dear Msakazi&apos;, we asked Francis to let us know more about the making of this work. Bambo working on stone. How did you discover the work of Bambo Sibiya and how did the collaboration come about? I met Bambo Sibiya at the Cité des Arts in Paris in 2013. He was on residency there after having won the Gerard Sekoto Prize in South Africa. I was interested in his work since he was a printmaker. We are a stone lithography studio and I discovered that he was not familiar with the technique. I suggested we work together and that is how it all started. We started work on a series of four stone lithographs. Since then, Bambo has been a regular visitor to our studio and we still work together to this day. To date we have created fifteen stone lithographs editions together. We are currently working on a new one which we hope to release later this year. What is it about his work that lends itself to printmaking? When I first met Bambo, he was working a lot with lino and in black &amp; white. His drawings were graphic. His first visit to Paris (and to our studio) encouraged him to explore colour. The size of the stones encouraged him to loosen up as did the new medium. This is very visible in the first series of Swenka lithographs (‘Swenka à Paris’ is a good example). In fact when he returned to South Africa he started working on his large fomat colour paintings. I think working on the stones contributed to that shift. Drawing on the stone is an unforgiving process. It is difficult to erase and redraw. So either one’s drawing has to be very precise, or loose. Bambo managed this looser approach with a lot of success in his first series of Swenkas. The looser marks encouraged Bambo to try the same thing on a lino, resulting in ‘Dear Msakazi’. We decided not only to create stone lithographs but to create large format linos additionally. ‘Dear Msakazi’ is the fruit of that collaboration. Francis checking the lino after printing it. Where was the artwork made? The artwork was created at Atelier le Grand Village in the south west of France where artists from the African continent come to work and revive the art of stone lithography. Artists enjoy working at the Atelier, collaborating, sharing and exploring diverse techniques from the rich experiences encountered here. Handmade stone lithographs are made using French presses dating from the 1860s. Other techniques are also integrated using monotype, lino gravure and photo plate lithography. The stone lithography process is the favoured technique at the Atelier as it respects most the quality and sensitivity of the artist’s drawing. The Atelier has worked with a selection of artists, mostly young South Africans who have won the Gerard Sekoto Prize and who came to France on residency at the Cité International des Arts in Paris. As well as Bambo, artists from Southern Africa that have worked at the studio include Mongezi Ncaphayi, Banele Khoza, Hanneke Benadé and Diane Victor. We have also worked with the Kenyan artist Evans Mbugua All editions produced at the studio are registered with the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

      <title>Corporate Art Collections get down to doing business differently</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/corporate-art-collections-get-down-to-doing-business-differently</link>
      <description>Corporate Art Collections get down to doing business differently Covid-19 has forced curators of corporate collections to find new ways to keep art in circulation ------------------------- Marieke Prinsloo-Rowe, Africa’s Fearless Thinker, commissioned by RMB The transition to remote working kickstarted byCovid-19 has, perhaps unsurprisingly, impacted corporate art collections in South Africa. It has translated into a radical downsizing of office space, which has reduced the amount of wall space for art and also limited opportunities to connect the staff of a company to its collection or, more broadly, to art. Corporate art collections are not static entities. They have grown and evolved with the changing fates of the businesses that support them, socio-political shifts and the evolution of the art market, which has lessened the initial role corporates played in the art ecosystem. This has forced curators to make adjustments, not only to the kind of works they set out to acquire, but other related programmes and their public interface via their collections and/or in-house galleries. On paper, corporate entities are free to create their mandates but what do we, the public, the art fraternity, expect of those South African companies that hold large collections of art, essentially our visual history? There was a time when corporate art collectors sustained a small art industry and were a lifeline for many artists and small art dealers. What role do they play now that our art ecosystem has expanded exponentially and our dealers and artists are active in the global art market? Are they bound to do the work that our public entities can’t – acquire the works produced by our best artists in the country? Preserve our art history and educate the public about art? Should they be focussed on supporting emerging talent rather than the big names who are in less need of promotion? Should they play a role in job creation as per the state’s dictum for the creative and cultural industries? ‘Confrontation’, created by world-famous South African sculptor (of Italian descent), Edoardo Villa in 1978. Villa encapsulated the pain, defiance and anger from the Soweto student uprising in 1976 in a gigantic steel structure which became his largest non-commissioned outdoor work. ‘Confrontation’ has been fully restored and now takes prime position at RMB’s Think Precinct, courtesy of Boogertman architects who donated the piece to RMB when RMB took occupation of 1 Merchant Place in 1996 As with all issues that are related to culture, the answers are rarely straightforward. Even when some of the most well-known corporate collections were founded and decorating board rooms might have appeared a simple mandate - as Stefan Hundt, curator of the Sanlam collection has observed; &quot;art in the workplace is rarely passively accepted&quot;. Corporate collections in South Africa seem to have been established in waves, Standard Bank and Sanlam’s collections in the 60s, Sasol in the 80s. However, it was the dawn of a democratic dispensation in the 90s that persuaded several other corporate entities – MTN, Spier – to initiate art acquisition policies. “There was a radical postmodern shift in corporate art collecting practice in South Africa at that time,” recalls Niel Nortje curator of the MTN collection. “The aim was to mould MTN’s inventory profile into one that provided both historical and cultural depth and brought together reflections of South Africa’s divided past and multi-layered present in an attempt to re-contextualise South African art history while also supporting artists,” he adds. The Spier collection was guided by less weighty ideas, viewing artistic expression almost as documents of varied lived experiences. Blessing Ngobeni, Figures and Fish, 2015, acrylic and collage on canvas, 84 x 118 x 3.5 cm, a recent acquisition for the Sanlam Art Collection “As a collection that started off in the early years of democratic freedom in South Africa it reflects the work of artists that were, for the first time, allowed freedom of expression. We weren’t guided by political or social themes, but rather we wanted to reflect the experience of South Africans in this process of transition and towards a hopeful future,” observes Mirna Wessels, director of the Spier Arts Trust. It was a scathing article written by Elza Miles at the end of the 80s titled Kuns en die groot korporasies (Art and the big corporations) that set the Sanlam collection (and probably others) in a new direction, according to Hundt. “The corporate art collections faired badly in her estimate and result in nothing more than self-aggrandisement and self-promotion. Public criticism such as this combined with the lack of an adequate budget for the purchase of works, put the Sanlam art advisory committee under some pressure to reassess the collection’s status and progress,” suggested Hundt. This led to “a shift in consciousness amongst the committee members towards more contemporary artists and the realisation that there were serious gaps in the collection with regards to works by Black artists.” The &apos;90s also saw an interest in the investment value of the artworks in the Sanlam collection. This was due to “the company using funds acquired from policyholders,” according to Hundt. The investment value aspect of works interestingly doesn’t appear to have been a guiding motivation for many of these corporate collections. “We don’t buy only from a small group, and do not focus solely on emerging or established artists. We never buy with the intent to maximise on investment,” says Wessels. RMB&apos;s corporate collection was “not built to have a definite monetary value, but rather one that would be true to the ethos of the business,” comments Carolynne Waterhouse, who heads the creative counsel at that financial institution. Thoka Frans, Go wa ke go tsoga, oil on blanket This may have been the case for a number of corporate collectors, perhaps as there was little intention of selling works and realising their value in the secondary market – indeed most of the works that are sold off are those deemed to be ‘less relevant’. This has been the case for the First Rand collection – an amalgamation of the First National Bank and Rand Merchant Bank collections. Its curator Beth Van Heerden recently sold off a large collection of ‘botanical’ works. “Tastes do change and the composition of our staff has changed and we have to look at art that appeals to our staff,” says Van Heerden. However various curators responded to the shifts in South Africa’s society and political landscape, what seems certain is that corporate collectors provided a lifeline to artists and dealers until the mid-noughties when the country’s art ecosystem started to grow exponentially, due to globalisation, which allowed them to pursue opportunities in western art capitals, and a wider interest in art collecting locally. However, this has not shifted the importance of corporate collectors in the arts landscape. “My opinion is that corporate collections are more important now, but primarily in their capacity as custodians of the works already in their possession. This is especially important if we consider the various challenges public collections currently face, mostly due to financial restraints,” says Cate Terblanche, Art Curator, Sasol Art Collection. As collections have matured and a more buoyant art market has evolved, some corporate collectors have deepened their contribution via a variety of initiatives to support artists at different levels in their careers. Certainly, Waterhouse, who heads the creative counsel at RMB, suggests that their support is in-depth and not only focussed on the visual arts. “We support organisations across a variety of creative disciplines, to unlock talent and social transformation through the arts, through the RMB Fund/FirstRand Foundation. We fund beneficiaries to promote access to quality arts education and excellence in music, dance, drama, visual arts and heritage, with the goal of enabling young talent to participate effectively in the economy,” she says. To some degree, it seems that the acquisitions process that curators were engaged in, naturally evolved into other initiatives to support artists. “Over time the focus became increasingly centred on the various Sasol sponsorships, such as the Sasol Wax awards, the KKNK and the Sasol New Signatures Art Competition, which was first sponsored in 1990,” says Terblanche. Thoka Frans, Moipolai Ga llelwe Sello Sa Gagwe ke, oil on prison blanket, a recent acquisition for the Sanlam Art Collection For Spier &quot;a holistic approach to artist support naturally evolved from our acquisition process. As a not-for-profit trust, our stated purpose is to provide career development opportunities for artists. This sourcing ecosystem came about in 2004 and led to the development of programmes focused on each level of artist career status,” says Wessels. Have the collections taken a back seat? Particularly now post Covid-19 when office space is shrinking in the wake of remote working and the in-house galleries and display areas for exhibitions aimed at the public or staff were closed during the pandemic and became less vital spaces. “We have resumed making acquisitions but these are few and far between. Some from auctions and occasionally from a private sale. In total, some 10 works over the last three years,” says Hundt. Sasol’s collecting strategy remains tied to the Sasol New Signatures competition, says Terblanche. Before Covid-19 Sasol “had a very active programme of art events at Sasol Place, which included our own version of ‘First Thursdays’, where we had walkabouts and short lectures throughout the day.” The pandemic has seen Sasol make use of virtual platforms, particularly for the New Signatures. “It’s been a matter of necessity, but I’m not totally convinced that the virtual arena is the optimal way to go, definitely not as a stand-alone approach. There is something to be said for viewing art in person, art is after all an experience.” Covid-19 saw MTN invest in virtual platforms such as the UJ Art Gallery Moving Cube ( https://movingcube.uj.ac.za/ ), Imbali’s Adventuring Into Art website ( https://imbaliartbooks.org.za/ ) and their own virtual art gallery MTN | making a difference , which Nortjie says has &quot;exponentially increased our ability to share MTN’s Art Collection with the public&quot;. Educating the staff about art in the post-Covid world initially proved tricky. Before Covid-19 Van Heerden strategically used a space that led into the staff canteen to stage exhibitions not only of works in the collection but also to allow art to be sold. Artist Proof Studios for example staged an exhibition in this space. Virtual exhibition staged by MTN during the pandemic “All sales were conducted through them. We would pay for the opening night event. The idea was that the staff would be encouraged to buy some of the works and start their own collections,” says Van Heerden. Meeting rooms, foyers and co-working spaces have become the focal spaces for the First Rand art collection in the wake of remote working, says Van Heerden. Conversely, new opportunities for First Rand to exhibit art and support artists also opened up through Covid-19 when they turned some unoccupied space on the ground floor of the FirstRand campus in Sandton into a pop-up gallery they dub Art &amp; About. There are other ways for the art in corporate collections to circulate – such as through loans to institutions or other businesses – FirstRand have loaned works to the Rand Club among others, according to Van Heerden. With around 5000 artworks in their collection, keeping the artworks in view is challenging. “We are not buying art for the storeroom,” she quips. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based art advisor, journalist and independent researcher</description>

      <title>JH PIERNEEF: IN/SIGHT</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/jh-pierneef-in-sight</link>
      <description>JH PIERNEEF: IN/SIGHT A single-artist auction dedicated to a modernist master Jacob Hendrik Pierneef, Huis, Oud-Pretoria (Nilant 31), Linocut , R12 000 – 16 000 Strauss &amp; Co is pleased to announce a single-artist auction devoted to one of South Africa’s most renowned and iconic painters, JH Pierneef. The selection of works gathered for IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF, a first-of-its-kind auction dedicated to this modernist master, includes paintings, drawings and linocuts made through the first half of the twentieth century. Dr Alastair Meredith, head of Strauss &amp; Co’s art department, will conduct the live-steamed auction from Joburg on Monday, 26 July 2021 at 6pm. Register &amp; bid here. “By presenting over 50 examples, made over almost half-a-century, individual works are better contextualized,” says Meredith, an authority of early twentieth century South African art. “My hope is that this focused sale will provide collectors with a sense of the development of this artist’s remarkable career. Pierneef’s deep affection for the soil, his keen sense of balanced design and his flair for the dramatic and monumental make his pictures at once familiar and enthralling.” Pierneef’s principal subject was the South African landscape. He is best known for his depictions of vast and breath-taking vistas, lonely farmhouses, architectonic cloudbursts and moving bushveld silhouettes. The lots featured in IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF encompass all these subjects and showcase his proficiency with oil, casein, watercolour, pastel, graphite, etching and linocut. Jacob Hendrik Pierneef, Matlala, Pietersburg (Nilant 64), Linocut, R30 000 – 50 000 The two premier lots are oils that date from the two different decades of Pierneef’s prolific career. Painted in 1944, Landscape with Rocks and Trees (estimate R1.8 – 2.4 million) showcases the artist’s skilful organisation of space and his capacity to render solitude amidst the fullness of nature. Painted a decade later, in 1953, Clouds over the Karoo (estimate R1.8 – 2.4 million) shows a monumental and architectonic cloud formation high above a moody and stunningly beautiful Karoo landscape. Other high-value oils in this sale include Landscape with Trees and Aloe (estimate R1.2 – 1.6 million), a spectacular scene of unfolding scenery rendered in a beautifully modulated palette, and Acacia in the Veld from 1940 (estimate R1.5 – 2 million), a bushveld scene capturing the unadulterated beauty of the dry winter months of South Africa’s interior. A majestic, stylised acacia dominates Bushveld Tree (estimate R1 – 1.5 million), a work defined by serene colour harmonies. Painted in 1952, the magnificent Cloudburst Storm (estimate R1 – 1.5 million) showcases the artist’s extraordinary ability to interpret atmospheric conditions, and his innate sense of natural drama. JH Pierneef Jonkershoek, Kremetartboom, Bosveld, N.T. (Nilant 73), Linocut , R30 000 – 40 000 “IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF is a wonderful opportunity to see and appreciate the work of a single artist without distractions,” says Susie Goodman, an executive director at Strauss &amp; Co. “It also presents an opportunity to a wide range of collectors, from the young collector hoping to acquire an early linocut, to the seasoned collector interested in a distinctive territory, style or medium – as is offered by his dazzling, small-scale caseins, of which the sale includes a remarkable 1924 work depicting the magnificent peaks of Jonkershoek.” IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF follows on Strauss &amp; Co’s highly successful online sale African Lion: John Muafangejo Works from the Orde Levinson Collection in May. The 153-lot sale, Strauss &amp; Co’s first-ever sale devoted to a single artist, achieved R3.36 million with a 76% lot sell-through rate and established a new world record price for Muafangejo. IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF acknowledges the current huge demand among collectors for works by Pierneef across all price points. Meredith identifies two works that may be of particular interest to Pierneef aficionados. The undated watercolour Stad in Basotho Land (estimate R250 000 – 350 000) depicts the Maluti mountains and shows the artist experimenting with geometric abstraction. The undated oil Rooiplaat (estimate R400 000 – 500 000) is a gentle, expressive work depicting a beloved camping spot on the Pienaars River north of Pretoria. Camp Tent (estimate R150 000 – 200 000) is a lovely companion piece to the latter work. Although closely associated with the South African landscape, Pierneef also painted views of Namibia, Seychelles and Zanzibar. IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF includes a strong selection of Namibian scenes. The oils Erongo Mountains (estimate R300 000 – 500 000) and Silent Sentinels, Omatako (estimate R400 000 – 600 000) date from his first painting trip in 1923, and Okahandja (estimate R600 000 – 800 000) is dated 1929. “Pierneef’s Namibian pictures are shot through with an electric glow,” says Meredith, who has authored a comprehensive e-catalogue to accompany the sale. “He certainly delighted in the shifting colours and patterns over the landscape as the sun arced through a clear, vast sky.” IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF includes a striking miscellany of prints, including two linocuts depicting Boer statesman Paul Kruger, dated 1924 and 1929, as well as various Transvaal and Cape architectural scenes. The linocut Ou Poortjie, Stellenbosch (estimate R20 000 – 30 000) depicts an extant gate and was made during the artist’s important Stellenbosch visit in 1921. The rarest print is View of Pretoria through Trees (estimate R50 000 – 60 000), the only etching in the sale, which was printed in a single edition in 1912. JH Pierneef, Wilgerboom, Fonteine, Pretoria (Nilant 84), Linocut, R20 000 – 30 000 Due to current Covid-19 regulations, IN/SIGHT: JH PIERNEEF will be presented as a live-streamed auction through Strauss &amp; Co’s website. This single-artist auction will commence on Monday, 26 Jul 2021 at 6pm . Register, Browse and Bid .</description>

      <title>The Africa Centre London – Unveiling of the Contemporary African Art Collection</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/the-africa-centre-london-unveiling-of-the-contemporary-african-art-collection</link>
      <description>The Africa Centre London – Unveiling of the Contemporary African Art Collection --------------------------------------- The Africa Centre is opening new headquarters on the Southbank in London. The new building is set to contribute significantly to the growth of a new cultural hub. The Africa Centre first opened its doors in 1964 and was inaugurated by the first president of Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda. It was originally located in Covent Garden. The role of the Centre was to promote a different narrative of Africa, at a time when the continent was steadily gaining its independence. It was also a home away from home for many Africans who were in exile or passing through London. Gerald Chukwuma, I CAME, 2020, mixed media on wood, courtesy of the artist and Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery Archbishop Desmond Tutu used to meet then-future South African head of state, Thabo Mbeki, at the bar and described the Centre as a home ‘to all who are Africans, and all those who have a care for the interests of the continent and its people’. Since its inception, The Africa Centre has programmed conferences and a variety of cultural events that continue to this day to shift the narrative of the continent. The works by notable artists exhibited at the Centre include Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid, Chris Ofili and John Akomfrah. Barthélémy Toguo, A Short Little Story, 2009, lithograph, courtesy of the artist and Galerie Lelong &amp; Co Art from Africa is the cornerstone of the Centre going forward. A major project, which has received the support of Nando’s UK, is the restoration and re-display of a large mural painted in the 80’s by the Mozambican modernist artist Malangatana in the Covent Garden building. In the words of the Centres&apos; chairman, Oba Nsugbe, ‘the fact that it was painted by an artist of such artistic and political significance, makes this work the embodiment of the charity&apos;s mission.’ The art advisory Walker Art was appointed to build the permanent collection of contemporary African art in collaboration with the Centre. The collection will be displayed throughout the building, which includes a pan-African restaurant, bar and performance space, and gallery space for exhibitions and hire. Leilah Babirye, Kuchu Series (Queer Ugandans), 2019, acrylic on paper, courtesy the artist and Gordon Robichaux, New York and Stephen Friedman Gallery, London The collection aims to be as representative as its modest size permits of current art practices on the continent, and to be diverse in terms of gender, generational and regional representation. It includes artists at different stages of their career such as 25-year-old Cinthia Sifa Mulanga from the DRC, who was recently commissioned by Gucci, and the very well-established South African William Kentridge. Latitudes and Jillian Ross Print, together with the artist, donated a print produced collaboratively. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Ne lave pas ton visage (do not wash your face), R 12,500.00 ex. VAT, BUY NOW The collection features artists from North to South, and East to West Africa, including Moroccan Hassan Hajjaj, South African Thenjiwe Niki Nkosi, Ugandan Leilah Babirye and Cameroonian Barthélémy Toguo. Rufai Zakari, Chelsea I, 2021, plastic bags and food wraps, courtesy of the artist and Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery Reflecting the Africa Centre’s purpose, the collection stands strong by its diversity against reducing contemporary African art to a single story. Black figuration and materiality are well represented and so are abstraction and conceptualism. African identities, forced migration, post colonialism and globalism, Africa-based LGBTQ activism and women activism are major themes in the collection. The collection is on permanent view at the Africa Centre, 66-68 Great Suffolk Street, London from mid-June 2022.

      <description>Latitudes collaborates with Artnet and Africa First to promote new artistic voices from Africa African art takes to the world stage once again, at the Africa Present auction Latitudes will be co-curating the &quot;Meet&quot; Section within Artnet Auctions’ second Africa Present sale, an auction designed to highlight the work of up-and-coming as well as established artists from the African continent. Artnet is a leading resource for buying, selling, and researching art online. Founded in 1989, the online platform has revolutionised the way people discover and collect art today. “Latitudes is thrilled to be able to partner with a giant of the industry, in order to both broaden the collector base for art from Africa and set values for contemporary, living artists on the auction market,” says Lucy MacGarry, co-founder of Latitudes Online. The Africa Present auction, a partnership between Artnet and Africa First by Serge Tiroche, is a dynamic initiative that uses the reach, contacts, and capabilities of Artnet’s global art marketplace to raise awareness about contemporary artists from Africa. In a forward-thinking bid to feature artists across all career stages, the auction lots are categorised into three sections: Meet, Support and Invest. Turiya Magadlela, Imibala, Pantyhose with Acrylic sealer on canvas, 100cmx 100cm Latitudes Online, which was founded during the 2020 lockdown, has made a name for itself, not only as a platform that promotes and sells art from the African continent, but also as an organisation that focuses on identifying and supporting new talent. It was therefore a natural fit for the two parties to come together, and for Latitudes to co-curate the Meet section of the upcoming sale, in which new talent is showcased. “Currently, there is an explosion of fresh talent on the continent, and we’re delighted to be able to introduce these new voices to the huge global audience that Artnet has built over the past 32 years,” says Roberta Coci, co-founder of Latitudes Online.

      <title>Aspire Art: The Present Future: A Private Collection of African &amp; International Contemporary Art</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/aspire-art-the-present-future-a-private-collection-of-african-international-contemporary-art</link>
      <description>The Present Future: A Private Collection of African &amp; International Contemporary Art --------------------------------- Wycliffe Mundopa, Paradise of Vice, 2015 Aspire Art is honoured to present a carefully curated single-owner sale. The Present Future: A Private Collection of African &amp; International Contemporary Art is set to impress and intrigue collectors this June. Thrilled to have been entrusted with this important collection, Ruarc Peffers, Aspire Art managing director, proudly states, “Aspire Art is the leading auction house for late-20th Century and Contemporary art in Africa, for Africa. Our most recent single-owner collection – Art, Life and Love: The Collection of Nwabisa Xayiya in 2021 – demonstrated this fact unequivocally. We are proud to follow this up with a new single-owner collection of leading contemporary art from Africa and further afield, comprising some of the finest examples from many of South Africa’s leading contemporary visionaries. Aspire has become known for bringing the most exciting and top artists of tomorrow to auction, and this collection honours that commitment – for the collectors of today, we present to you a collection of tomorrow.” The sale is led by two superb tapestries by the much-celebrated South African superstar Athi-Patra Ruga. In his sensuous works, the artist uses playful imagery to critique convention, question what we think of as normative and challenge a heteronormative social construction of African history and knowledge. Kate Gottgens, Bromide Beach, 2016 Other highlights include three magnificent large-scale canvases by Zimbabwean painter Wycliffe Mundopa. Winner of the 2021 FNB Art Prize, the artist has been dubbed the “Painter of Modern African Life” by acclaimed academic Ashraf Jamal, who elaborates that in his vibrant, daringly brash, wildly dissolute, expressionist canvases “we find an artist hyper-alert to the moment – what it takes to make art now.” Also confronting modern African life but with a distinctly different aesthetic – and highlighting the rich diversity of artistic production in Africa right now – is Rwandan artist Serge Alain Nitegeka. Referencing journeys of displacement, forced African migration and the refugee, Obstacle 1; Studio study III from 2012 is a monumental, bold, abstract study in black, white and red. Contemporary collectors will also have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to view and acquire Cape Town conceptual artist, Ed Young’s awe-inspiring sculptural installation titled Hero ­– a mesmerising rendition of the artist as superhero, or rather mildly dejected antihero ­– a challenge to the impervious, almighty, hero status of white masculinity. Mohau Modisakeng, Ditaola XVI, 2014 Representative of Africa, right now, in the present and indeed into the future, this vibrant sale of over 100 lots is divided into two parts; a Live Auction and a Timed-Online auction – giving bidders two separate opportunities to participate. The Live Auction will go under the hammer at Aspire Art in Johannesburg in a live, physical and live-streamed event on Wednesday, 22 June at 6pm. The Online-only Auction opens on Thursday 16 June and closes on Thursday 23 June from 6pm (lots will close in 30-second intervals). Collectors and art lovers alike are invited to view the collection from Thursday 9 June. The Live Sale collection will be on view at Aspire Art Johannesburg, 32 Bolton Road, Parkwood, while the Online Sale collection will be on view at Aspire Art, Cape Town, 37A Somerset Road, De Waterkant. Serge Alain Nitegeka, Obstacle 1, Studio Study III, 2012 For more information contact Aspire Art here For additional images, interviews or walkabout appointments, please contact Bronwyn Coppola on +27834509111 or bmgcoppola@gmail.com</description>

      <title>Explore Innovative Works by Four Daring Zimbabwean Artists on Artnet Auctions</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/explore-innovative-works-by-four-daring-zimbabwean-artists-on-artnet-auctions</link>
      <description>Explore Innovative Works by Four Daring Zimbabwean Artists on Artnet Auctions Fadzai Muchemwa, curator of the 2022 Zimbabwe Pavilion at the Venice Biennale writes about four up and coming Zimbabwean artists featured in Africa Present on Artnet Auction. At the upcoming 59th Venice Biennale in 2022, Zimbabwe will be represented by four exceptional artists whose innovative works interrogate the ambiguities between reality and fantasy. These four artists—Ronald Muchatuta, Wallen Mapondera, Kresiah Mukwazhi, and Terrence Musekiwa— create evocative works that are politically charged, pushing back against the use of brute force and grabs of power plaguing their nation. Right now, works by all four artists are being offered now in the “ MEET ” section of Africa Present , live now on Artnet Auctions , and co-curated by Latitudes , a new online marketplace for contemporary art from Africa. Created in partnership with Serge Tiroche, this sale is live now through September 14. The below five works move beyond the usual discourse of Zimbabwe, depicting the country as a space of encounters, resilience, and small acts of care, against the spectacle of human suffering. They attend to both the spectacular and the mundane experiences in the face of catastrophe and polarisation. The convergence of this group of artists goes beyond protest art’s rigid, often formulaic confines. Ronald Muchatuta - Her Bliss (2020) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $7,000–9,000. Her Bliss by Ronald Muchatuta is self-reflexive, satirical, and deliberately digressive. Inspired by the character Anta in Djibril Diop Mambéty’s 1973 film Touki Bouki , this work explores issues of migration and hardship. Her Bliss contains various visual elements that nod to Mambéty’s seminal work, including the pool, the goat, the charged energy, and, of course, Anta. The warm, summery colours represent the attractive life that one envisions when coming from a place of darkness, a reminder of the social, political, cultural, and geographic contention that one associates with Zimbabwe. Yet, there are other layers to the messaging of the work. The reference to Touki Bouki is a tongue-in-cheek exploration of issues of seeing, desire and representation. Bouki is a clever and cunning Wolof and a popular character who causes mischief and cheats his way to what he wants. Much like the character Tsuro (the hare) in Shona folklore, the reference to Bouki speaks of the use of metaphor and imagery to hide in plain sight. Wallen Mapondera - Kubvunura III (2017) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Est. $9,000-12,000. Kubvunura III , the title of Wallen Mapondera’s work, is a word with a lexical ambiguity that talks of unbundling, unraveling, and uncovering. “Kubvunura” is also a play on “Kubvondora,” a colloquial Shona word that means whistleblowing, an apt description of Mapondera’s practice of socio-political commentary. The distinctive materials that Mapondera uses in this work, the pieces of cardboard and the sewing thread, speak directly to his practice and draw from the lives of the ordinary man at the mercy of unscrupulous politicians and forces of capital. Mapondera looks to cardboard packaging as a tool for survival and exploration. Kresiah Mukwazhi - Unreachable Parts Painted Gold (2018) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $7,000–9,000. Kresiah Mukwazhi’s Unreachable Parts Painted Gold is a celebration of women who survive, at all costs, in a world of precarity. Her work delves into the underbelly of the sex work industry, chastising a society that continues to push sex workers into the shadows. Unreachable Parts necessitates and provokes active spectatorship and conversations about governing where the body is the territory being governed. Mukwazhi represents or poses a threat to social order through her textile work. She complicates the dichotomy between what is seen and what is said. Bold choices and socio-political themes place marginalised protagonists in the centre of her works, seeking to realise an elusive dream. Terrence Musekiwa - Kubuda Mudope 7 (2021) Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $5,000–7,000. Terrence Musekiwa’s Kubuda Mudope 7 directly translates to Out of the mud. The word “dope” (mud) is an allusion to the predicaments and exigent circumstances that one must escape. Musekiwa utilises scraps in his practice, fusing stone sculptures with other scrap materials, as a commentary on the fear and survival tactics that many utilise to adapt and to survive. Terrence Musekiwa - Muimbi (Singer) 2020 Available now in Africa Present on Artnet Auctions. Estimate $3,000–5,000. Much like Kubuda Mudope 7 , Musekiwa’s piece Muimbi (Singer) is created from his signature technique of combining hand-carved stone with found and industrial objects. The artist’s visual language wrestles with convention to simultaneously challenge and pay homage to Zimbabwean tradition, creating a dialogue about the mechanics, politics, and the micro and macro trade systems of his home country.

      <description>&apos;Are There Any Left?’: A Sales Frenzy at London’s 1-54 Fair Reflects the Heated Demand for African Contemporary Art The fair features 48 galleries showing work by more than 150 African and diaspora artists. Written by Amah-Rose Abrams , October 14, 2021 Installation view of the 1-54 Art Fair 2021 In 2020 1-54, the contemporary African art fair, was the only physical fair to take place in London—even then, it was reduced to a hybrid event with only 20 physical exhibitors, about half of its usual footprint. Against a backdrop of a rising international profile for art and artists working across the continent, the fair’s ninth U.K. edition opened today at Somerset House to a changed landscape on many fronts. At the preview for press and VIPs, visitors came hungry for information on artists they did not yet know and eager to buy work by those that they did. As the day progressed, fairgoers stayed on, sunning themselves on and around the courtyard commission by the London-based artist Lakwena Maciver. Little did they know that half of the sculptures—from the series I’ll Bring You Flowers , 2021—had already been sold, for £20,000 ($27,400) each by Vigo Gallery. As the afternoon progressed and the aisles became packed, Dutch gallery Nuweland—a first-time participant—sold out of sculpture by recent art-school graduate Ben Orkin, with one collector running in, shouting, ‘Are there any left?’ before snapping up the last one available.

Last year we were looking into the unknown,” the fair’s founder and director, Touria El Glaoui, told Artnet News. This year’s event welcomes 34 returning galleries and 14 new exhibitors representing 150 African and diaspora artists from 23 countries, including Angola, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, as well as Brazil, the Netherlands, Italy, the United States, Switzerland, Belgium, and the U.K. In a noticeable shift, the past years’ focus on figuration is giving way to more abstract works and those employing yarn and fabric—as well as ceramics, in keeping with a trend across the London fairs. The talked-about standouts include Eddy Kamuanga Ilunga at October Gallery, Nabil El Makhloufi’s dark and beautiful paintings at Nil Gallery, and paintings by Zanele Muholi—mostly known for her photography and film—who had her first survey at Tate Modern in 2020, shown by Galerie Carole Kvasnevski of Paris. Installation view of the 1-54 Art Fair 2021, Courtesy of 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair Sales came hot and fast across the fair. Ed Cross Fine Art, of London, sold out its booth dedicated to the work of local artist Sahara Longe, who combines technical skill with a touch of satire in paintings that remix classical portraiture with contemporary Black figuration. Three works went to a U.K. collection, at prices ranging from £8,000 to £20,000 ($11,000–$27,400), and After Party , 2021, sold to a museum in Asia for £16,500 ($22,600). Mayfair’s Richard Saltoun, joining the fair for the first time, sold a work by South Africa’s Berni Searle for £24,000 ($32,900) and seven paintings by the artist, writer, and curator Everlyn Nicodemus, all in the £15,000-to-£30,000 ($20,600–$41,000) range. Collectors also flocked to two Parisian comers: Galerie Eric Dupont, which sold four of Roméo Mivekannin’s striking portraits on fabric in two hours, for prices between £5,000 and £20,000 ($6,800–$27,300), and Galerie Dominique Fiat, which sold three photographs by Malala Andrialavidrazana to private foundations for between £13,000 and £16,000 ($17,800–$21,900). Accra’s kingmaker—Gallery 1957, which represents Ghanian breakout star Amoako Boafo—reported sales of “many works” between £3,500 and £20,000 ($4,800–$27,400) at its booth, which features works by Serge Attukwei Clottey, Godfried Donkor, and Arthur Timothy. From the Ethiopian capital, Addis Fine Art placed all of its works on paper by recent Saatchi Yates star Tesfaye Urgessa for £10,000 ($13,687) apiece, while DADA Gallery, of Lagos, sold three fabric works by Bunmi Agusto priced at £8,000 ($10,949) each. Even smaller outlets with less well-known names who had yet to close a sale were optimistic and upbeat heading into the weekend. Nabil El Makhloufi, Night Veil (2021), Courtesy of the artist and Nil Gallery, Paris Notably, these deals were made within the first few hours of the preview, perhaps reflecting an altered schedule (a day later, rather than coinciding with, Frieze’s vernissage) or the global socio-political shift of the past 18 months. Certainly, interest in contemporary African art has soared; in the past year, Amoako Boafo has collaborated with Kim Jones of Dior, and other artists have been picked up by blue-chip galleries; for example, Otis Kwame Kye Quaicoe joining Almine Rech. “I think there’s definitely been a moment after the Black Lives Matter movement, and we’re still seeing the benefit of people’s attention and awareness of artists coming from Africa, the African diaspora,” Galoui said. “We have also seen this week this engagement with artists from Africa or the diaspora, with a lot of the main London galleries showcasing some unbelievable work.” Eddy Kamuanga Ilunga, Untitled (2021), Courtesy of the artist and October Gallery, London However, even after eight years and the launch of companion fairs in New York and Marrakesh, El Glaoui was reluctant to take full credit for bringing the world’s attention to the continent’s rich and varied creative output. “I’m hoping that it’s a constant evolution,” she says. “I’m hoping that we are going to see this engagement and integration continue in the long term. But we know that the art world is very trendy—they love new things, and they love being in the right moment at the right time—so I hope that at least 1-54 will be able to be that place in the platform. We are having an amazing moment.” 1-54 runs through Sunday, October 17, at Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R. This article was originally published on Artnet .</description>

      <title>The art of illustration</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/the-art-of-illustration</link>
      <description>The art of illustration A generation of artists has been producing works in different mediums that draw inspiration from illustration. Some of the galleries that supported them have closed, but their works remain important and are highly collectible. -------------------------------- Neil Badenhorst, symphonia IX (my wait is u), 2021, R 9,870.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY What is the line between illustration and art? This question has had pertinency in South Africa for some time, particularly due to a noticeable increase in works with an illustrative quality featuring heavily in some of the youngest galleries. This has not only been confined to paper drawings as an artist’s main practice, or editioned prints, but also paintings by artists that boast an illustrative quality, such as the landscape paintings by Andrew Sutherland or Shakil Solanki’s oil or ink works depicting male subjects. Some artists draw more heaving from a comic-book language and have harnessed this to make wry commentary on feminist issues. Zhi Zulu, Escapism, 2021, R 1,852.17 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Coincidentally, the galleries where these kinds of works had been finding traction – Salon 91 and Smith Studio in Cape Town and No End Contemporary in Joburg have all closed their doors. The latter two during Covid-19 and the former more recently. Might this spell the end of illustrative artworks? Many of the artists producing them are graphic designers with commercial careers on the side, the other more prominent artists aligned to the above-mentioned galleries have found their way into other galleries, while the others you have to track down and follow on Instagram if you want to keep up with their work. Atang Tshikare, Ea Tshela, 2019, R 12,400.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY This makes these illustrative-inspired artworks even more attractive for collectors; as you have to hunt a little harder for the works you want and you can buy directly from the artists. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons these kinds of works were finding traction in the younger (this would exclude Salon 91 as they existed for over a decade) galleries that serviced a younger group of collectors is not only were they supporting their peers but the works are largely inexpensive and accessible. Illustrative work often lends itself to editioning and editioned prints have are within reach of the young creative class in South Africa who tended to frequent these galleries. So, what defines an ‘illustrative’ quality? It may well be subjective, as there are no hard and fast definitions, save perhaps being more decorative, perhaps more detailed, and relating to commercial art forms – such as graphic art, fashion illustration, the publishing industry, advertising, printmaking and comic book art. Of course, these worlds of design have collided with the art world most notably since the 1960s when commercial art and advertising imagery formed the basis for Pop Art. South African artists have been borrowing from the world of design and advertising for some time. Brett Murray comes to mind with his cartoon-like characters that define his sculptural works to this day but also in his more political paintings where his visual language borrowed from posters and adverts, particularly his imitation of wry slogans in scripto-visual works such as “Promises, Promises, Promises” or “Our Religion must win.” Nina Torr, Just Turn Your Back, 2021, R 4,200.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Perhaps Anton Kannemeyer and Conrad Botes – the creators of Bitterkomix, the dark, satirical comic books designed to critique and rail against repressive Afrikaner culture - could be more closely credited with smudging the line between art and illustration, particularly as they grew over time into independent artists and the comic book vocabulary traversed into art and their work was made for gallery shows. While their works have come under criticism for being less than ‘woke’ with regards to race and gender, they may well have influenced a younger generation of artists in South Africa to employ a dark illustrative vocabulary. The now-defunct, No End Contemporary gallery in Joburg became home to many young artists making editioned dark satirical paper works or prints that quite literally were grounded in a comic book language – such as Elio Moavero, Shaun Francis, Christi Lee, Dillon Harland and Octavia Roodt. These artists may not have been influenced by Kannemeyer and Botes, perhaps they prepared collectors to more readily be open to art with a comic book twist. The younger set of art buyers that would frequent this Linden-based gallery were more than likely from the world of design and already appreciative of this kind of work. When you look at the bios of some of these artists they either work as graphic artists or are trained as illustrators. This is also the case for many of the artists that were represented by Cape Town based Salon 91 – from Berry Meyer, Jade Klara, Jean de Wet, Jessica Bosworth Smith, Katrine Classens, Matthew Prins, Nina Torr, Tara Deacon, Sara Pratt and Kirsten Sims. Olivié Keck, Better Me, 2021, R 15,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY As such art made in an illustrative vein, shall we say, has been driven by those with a background in illustration and graphic design. Presumably many spend their working days staring at a screen and drawing with digital tools, so these ink or watercolor paintings, paper or editioned works which are created by hand have provided them with the space to explore a different kind of practice and participate in the art market. Others come from a traditional art background, such as Solanki. Solanki’s works, which have popped up at exhibitions all over Cape Town, are defined by a high-detailed, decorative language that brings illustration, fabric design, and classical eastern art to mind. “I&apos;ve always been completely fascinated and captivated by Eastern traditional manuscripts and miniatures. The extraordinary details and those very vivid jewel-like colours have always inspired me. There&apos;s this inherent richness and grandeur, which feels quite fitting, especially when it comes to tying in queer dynamics and finding a kind of meeting place for those two factors. On a technical level it&apos;s what I enjoy most obviously finding an oscillation between the more painterly flowing marks and pieces, but at the same time, there&apos;s also more intricate, detailed work,” writes Solanki of his practice. Some of the artists who were represented by Smith Studio applied an illustrative language to textile works, evoking other kinds of commercial crafts such as Talia Ramkilawan and Michaela Younge. Since that gallery’s closure, they have found their way into more established ones – Whatiftheworld and Smac gallery respectively – most probably since textile works are more highly valued than drawings or editioned prints and they have subverted the narrative or decorative vocabularies they employ. Ultimately, what makes the works of this generation’s art collectible is that it is rewarding for collectors to fashion a collection where there is a strong stylisic thread and, importantly, that encompasses the expression of a ‘generation’.

      <description>Celebrating the Art, Life and Love of Nwabisa Xayiya, A Patron of the Arts Loyal Latitudes supporter, exemplary art collector and philanthropist, Nwabisa Xayiya who passed away last May will be celebrated with an impressive art auction in Joburg this month. Together, with her husband, Mikki, Nwabisa Xayiya had built one of the most impressive art collections of modern and contemporary South African art held by a private collector. Presented by Aspire Art Auctions and dubbed Art, Life and Love : The Collection of, the rare and impressive single owner auction comprises over 300 lots and objects. It is one of the most anticipated single owner collection auctions events taking place in South Africa for years. This is in part because it is expected to also provide an indication of how the art market has recovered from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and its related restrictions. Central to the story of the collection is how Xayiya became a symbol of a new generation of young black female art collectors in an art industry slowly clawing at transformation. She had become a confidant and patron to scores of young and emerging black artists in the country. Art, Life and Love : The Collection of Nwabisa Xayiya will open with a public preview from Saturday 23 October at the Xayiya Residence in Houghton, culminating in a Live auction, at the premises, on Sunday 31 October 2021 at 11am. Art lovers, collectors and all those who appreciate their culture and legacy, are invited to visit the preview on a by appointment basis and see the remarkable collection. The full sale of the collection will be divided into two parts, giving bidders two separate opportunities to participate in the auction. The Live Auction will see 100 lots of exclusive highlights from the collection included in a catalogue sale going under the hammer in a live, physical and live-streamed auction on Sunday 31 October 2021 at 11am, and the remainder of the collection will be included in an Online-only Auction opening on Wednesday 20 October and closing on Monday 1 November from 6pm.</description>

      <title>When art collections go public</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/when-art-collections-go-public</link>
      <description>When art collections go public Some African based collectors seem more interested in advancing art than their own taste, when they bring their works into the public realm. Others want to drum up the value and interest in the artists they support. ---------------------------- Alexis Preller, The Red Pineapples, oil on canvas board was part of the Tasso Foundation Collection of Important South African Art assembled by the Late Giulio Bertrand of Morgenster Estate. It was auctioned by Strauss &amp; Co. There comes a point, particularly with large or focused art collections, that their owners feel compelled to share the works with the wider public. This can be done through loans to museum shows, inviting curators to engage with it, or, in some instances, creating a private museum for it. Art is created to be seen after all and no one likes the idea of art sitting in storage. The more an artwork circulates, particularly in exhibitions the more likely its value will increase, or at least its pedigree and the overall status of the art collection. Attracting status to a collection has all sorts of benefits, not only will the sale of the works of it at auction have a better chance of fetching high estimates (or selling), but the collector might also in the process accrue some bargaining power with dealers and artists, who might be incentivised to offer healthy discounts or give them first dibs on sought after works. Ideally, dealers and artists prefer works to go to high-profile collectors or museums. Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art, bears the name of the German collector Jochen Zeitz. However, the museum itself is a private/public partnership where only a few works from his collection are shared with the public at this venue. Largely, works are loaned for exhibitions. While some high-profile collectors of African art opt to create buildings for their works and that of others, some are choosing to exploit technology by sharing and supporting the artists in their collections, through websites, Instagram accounts, and newsletters, where they might announce their new acquisitions or artists they have just “discovered”. There are estimated to be around 400 private museums in the world, according to Georgina Adam in The Rise and Rise of the Private Art Museum (2021). They are however expensive to build and maintain and there are costs in keeping them ‘relevant’ and useful to society, through programming and audience development. In South Africa, there are at least six private art museums or foundations. Interestingly, some of the private museums that have been established in this country haven’t necessarily been driven by a need to make a large contemporary collection available to the public due to a focus on historical works. The Javett Art Centre and the Norval Foundation are probably good examples of this, or at least we imagine this to be the case given their programming – Javett’s inaugural exhibition 101 Collecting Conversations: Signature Works of a Century relied on institutions loaning their eponymous signature works. An assumed (their collections are under lock and key) paucity of contemporary African works in these collections has been beneficial in the sense that the collectors behind these private and private/public partnership museums – The Javett family and Louis Norval and his family – have in a sense gifted an institution to the public rather than simply a collection. The drive to loan contemporary works has made for more interesting exhibitions and dialogues. The establishment of private art museums in South Africa, such as the Norval Foundation, is not only to do with collectors sharing their works, but to provide a space for dialogue between collections and works. Photography by Wieland Gleich The Johannesburg Contemporary Art Foundation should on paper be drawing from three collections as it is funded by three prominent art collectors Gordon Schachat, former deputy chairman and co-founder of African Bank Investments Ltd; Adi Enthoven, the chair and non-executive director of Hollard and executive chairman of private investment group Yellowwoods; and the former group president and CEO of MTN, Phuthuma Nhleko. These wealthy patrons all have considerable art collections and the Southern Collection, of which the Enthoven and Schachat families are also partners is also said to be one of the most comprehensive contemporary art collections in the country. However, at this modest private art museum - compared to the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art, the Javett or the Norval in terms of its dimensions - its programming, under the curatorship of Clive Kellner, also relies on loans from other collections. This is largely due to a focus on connecting South African contemporary art to that produced in the global south. In this way, the focus of these museums is not to simply parade the collectors’ taste in art but to stage meaningful conversations with some of their works. In the process, they are also providing much-needed opportunities for curators and new platforms for African art to be valued and validated and are increasing access to art. Some other well-known South African collectors such as Jack Ginsburg or Emile Stipp, a chief actuary at Discovery Health, have carved out collections largely focused on a particular medium. Ginsburg is renowned for his love for art books – that is artworks that resemble physical books or cunningly exploit this format. Works from this idiosyncratic collection are regularly displayed in a dedicated space at the Wits Art Museum. Stipp has a broad collection of artworks but decided to focus on collecting video works, which have been undervalued. Stanley Pinker, The Bathers , oil on canvas was part of the Tasso Foundation Collection of Important South African Art assembled by the Late Giulio Bertrand of Morgenster Estate. It was auctioned by Strauss &amp; Co. “Video art is so much easier to share, all you need is a room and a projector.” The pleasure of owning art is in sharing it, observed Stipp. “Art only has meaning when you share it and communicate what it is about,” he said. Some important collections only come into public view after their owners have deceased and they come up at auction. Such was the case with the highly publicised auction of the Nwabisa Xayiya&apos;s collection at Aspire Art Auctions. The Joburg socialite was still a young woman when cancer tragically took her life, but in her short lifespan, she had managed to acquire over 300 significant works with her husband Mikki Xayiya. A dedicated sale of a collection such as this not only resulted in a well-attended exhibition, the production of a researched catalogue, but also dispelled notions that young black collectors aren’t interested in historical works by white artists such as Pierneef. “Artists, artistic production, and the whole art-industry needs collectors and benefactors. It is crucial for the sustainability of the industry that we develop and cultivate ambassadors who see and feel the value of what art does for cultures and communities. Nwabisa was remarkable in this regard and I think she was a strong influence on many of her contemporaries, and a younger generation of burgeoning collectors, to start collecting. I believe we need more Nwabisa’s in our society,” says Ruarc Peffers, Senior Specialist, Managing Director Aspire Art Auctions house. Other significant, large collections of African art beyond Africa’s borders are shared via regular newsletters by the collectors. The French-owned Leridon collection (owned by Gervanne and Matthias Leridon) and the Israel-based Africa First collection established by Serge Tiroche are good examples of this approach. Their collections parade an independent identity from their owners – they have their own logos and websites, and conduct residency and other programming which supports artists whose works are in their collections. JCAF: The Johannesburg Contemporary Art Foundation was funded by three well-known art collectors, however, like other private art institutions in South Africa the emphasis is on loaning works from other collections to expand on knowledge about art. Photography by Graham de Lacy What is particularly striking about both of these collections is the fact that the only binding narrative appears to be that the works are made by African artists. In this way, they almost view African art as a ‘thematic’ – despite its broadness and diversity. The Leridons appear to view supporting African art as a philanthropic cause, whereas Tiroche appears more committed to driving up its value – through his association with auction houses, curating sales of it in the US such as Philips and using his Instagram account to document the prices works from his collection fetch on auction. In both instances, these collectors are playing an active role in not only supporting artists – through residencies and other programmes, but in encouraging those in their native countries and art markets in the US and Europe to pay more attention to art from our continent. Championing African art is admirable, though some might view this as paternalistic, or self-aggrandising. Yet the capital and promotion that has gone into the Leridon and Africa First collections have been so consistent and substantial that they have secured their importance and value to the African art market. William Kentridge, Tree, was part of the Tasso Foundation Collection of Important South African Art assembled by the Late Giulio Bertrand of Morgenster Estate. It was auctioned by Strauss &amp; Co. A museum, of course, solidifies this role in perpetuity. This may be why Jean Pigozzi, a well-known collector of African contemporary art, has recently announced he will build a museum in Cannes to house his collection. He has been collecting African art for 20 years now and has accumulated over 10 000 pieces, though he recently admitted in an interview with Artnet that only 2000 of them are significant. He too, as with other collectors, seems to view the African origin of the artist as the defining criteria for his collection, though perhaps there are some focused collections of works in it. The French-born entrepreneur wishes for his collection to be “recognised as the best African art collection.” Hopefully, a host of ambitious African-based collectors won’t leave it to the French to define what that appellation might entail. - Mary Corrigall is a Cape Town-based commentator, advisor and independent researcher The establishment of private art museums in South Africa, such as the Norval Foundation, is not only to do with collectors sharing their works, but to provide a space for dialogue between collections and works.

      <description>WTF are NFTs? Latitudes demystifies this future art-world staple Arclight&apos;s NFT artwork titled &quot;NAPOLEON NO DO PASS DIS&quot;, 2021 for @SuperRare, organized by @artxlagos is part of Reloading which features 10 Artists from across Africa Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have consumed the art-world of late, with onlookers equally fascinated and abhorred by this elusive new technology. With memes and algorithm-generated pixel art images selling for millions of dollars, it’s hardly surprising that the craze is being likened to tulip mania, but we’re here to tell you that no, NFTs are not going to quietly disappear. And here’s why. CryptoPunks and NBA dunks represent only a fraction of what NFTs have to offer. In fact, we’ll go so far as to say that these digital tokens have the potential to solve countless real-world problems, while radically changing the way we invest. Without going into too much detail, here’s a quick rundown of how NFTs work. The tokens are built on blockchains, and you can think of the blockchain system as a ledger that stores every NFT that has ever been created on it with a unique identification code. Once an NFT is created, it cannot be removed or replaced, making NFTs indispensable for proving origin and authenticating ownership. With this in mind, it’s clear why NFTs have found a place in the art, luxury brand and collectable markets, as they help combat fraud and forgery by providing digital verification of an item’s authenticity and ownership. In fact, Nike has patented a method to verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks. But it goes further than preventing fraud and protecting a collector’s valued asset. NFTs can provide end-to-end traceability, thus addressing the rising consumer demand to know how goods are sourced. Whether you’re using blockchain to track how a beer is made, from barley to bar, or tracing E-coli contamination in lettuce crops, the technology is set to revolutionise transparency in supply chain logistics. ID and certification is another application for NFTs, with forward-thinking Covid vaccine passports already adopting the technology. Seeing as it’s almost impossible to fake data on a blockchain, and that users’ information can be securely stored, this is a massive application for the technology. But what does it mean for the art world? For us, it’s not about Beeple works selling for $69 million dollars, and more about the technology changing the way we sell (and resell) art. The hype is necessary to pique everyone’s curiosity, but after it dies down, the real value of NFTs will shine through. Most notably, NFTs will be used to authenticate the originality of an artwork, and this can be extended into the realm of physical works, functioning as your traditional Certificate of Authenticity. Moreover, ownership can be logged on the blockchain, preventing fraud and forgery, while allowing the artist to retain their copyright and reproduction rights. When it comes to artists being fairly compensated for their work, NFTs ensure that they will receive a royalty every time their work is resold. This is because NFTs are minted through smart contracts that assign ownership and manage the transferability of the NFTs without a third party. Artists can use smart contracts to build even deeper rules into their smart contracts - such as rules preventing owners from selling the work within a certified time span, thus preventing the notorious practice of ‘flipping’ artworks. Essentially, NFTs can provide owners with certificates of authenticity relating to just about anything you can think of - from artwork, music, collectibles, to data and even real estate. While some may have considered (and hoped) them to be a flash in the pan, NFTs show no signs of slowing down. Latitudes has always advocated supporting independent artists, and making the art world accessible, which is why we’re ready to start talking NFTs and making them accessible for you.

      <title>Announcing the inaugural ANNA Award Winner</title>

      <description>Announcing the inaugural ANNA Award Winner: Lerato Nkosi Lerato Nkosi’s entry for the ANNA Award features words inspired by her reading of Bell Hooks’ All About Love: “The book held special resonance for me because of its reference to the author’s upbringing, and the values that developed out of her experiences,” says Lerato. ----------------------------------------- Sign-Up to Receive First Access to Lerato Nkosi&apos;s Work Lerato Nkosi is fascinated by the influence we wield over each other, and how – with a word of encouragement, a piece of advice or a gentle nudge in a certain direction – one person can change another’s life. She’s even more intrigued by the fact that, often, it’s a woman who holds this transformative power. Lerato’s reflection on this theme can be explained by her own life experience: growing up in the Mpumalanga village of Swalala, she was raised by her mother and grandmother – both strong, single women. “My father passed away when I was one year old, and my mother had to raise me and my siblings alone. In some ways, history was repeating itself – my grandfather had to leave my grandmother to earn money. He became a bus driver in Johannesburg, while she remained in Swalala to look after their eight children – all of whom have become successful in their own right.” Lerato had just 12 years to experience the nurturing of her two fierce female carers, before her grandmother fell ill, and her uncle suggested she move in with his family, where she could enjoy the benefits of growing up with two parents. Increased Alienation, 117 cm x 92 cm, 2022, ink and stamp on canvas It was also her uncle who suggested she study subjects like biology and physical science in high school – which, she admits, she failed dismally. “I was far more drawn to the visual arts,” Lerato says – which is why she chose to study fashion design at the Tshwane University of Technology. She followed this path for some time after graduation, moving to Cape Town where she took on a post as a visual merchandiser for a major retail chain before deciding to freelance as a trends forecaster. Then, in 2020, she decided it was time to focus on her art, around the same time she relocated to Johannesburg. “I’d always planned to get back into creating. Because it was something that came easily to me, I believed I could pick it up again when the time was right,” Lerato says. Her instinct was spot on: galleries had already begun taking notice of her work, starting with an exhibition at the AVA Gallery. Just a few years later, in 2021, she was chosen to take part in RMB Talent Unlocked; a showcase celebrating young female artists. Lerato maintains that programmes like this – and like the recently launched ANNA Award – are crucial platforms. “It’s vital that we create these opportunities for women artists. Our voices need to be heard,” she insists, pointing to the evolution of women as an object of the Gaze, as during the Renaissance, to today’s compelling creators. She takes her own role as a creator very seriously. Lerato explains that the message behind her ink and stamp depictions are amplified by her choice of words adorning the piece, usually a text she’s read or a scene from a film. The presence of these words means that the viewer is required to lean in to take a closer look, inviting them to engage with the meaning at a deeper level. Devotional Silence, 92 cm x 140 cm, 2022, ink and stamp on canvas Lerato’s entry for the ANNA Award featured words inspired by her reading of Bell Hooks’ All About Love: “The book held special resonance for me because of its reference to the author’s upbringing, and the values that developed out of her experiences,” Lerato says. In the same way, she often thinks about the resilience that she was gifted through her own upbringing, and how this helped her grow into the person she is today. That person is both focused and determined (“I feel like I manifested my ANNA Award win, because I knew it would open so many doors!” she says) – and while she’s proud of what her past holds, she’s even more excited about the future. Lerato is currently preparing for a number of international art competitions and, in each case, her body of work carries the same message. “I want to remind women of our strength. I want to tell whoever is looking at my work that we don’t have to be victims; we have the power to change our circumstances.” - article by Lisa Witepski Loss of Infancy, 130 cm x 90 cm, 2022, ink and stamp on canvas The ANNA Award is presented by Latitudes Online and ANNA Pure Organics, South Africa’s first locally manufactured, environmentally friendly and organic menstrual product range. As the winner of the prize, Lerato receives R100,000 cash, a one-month residency at PLAAS #inplaasvan in Franschhoek, South Africa, a profile on Latitudes Online, and a year’s supply of ANNA products.</description>

      <title>Where to See African Artists Around the World Right Now</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/where-to-see-african-artists-around-the-world-right-now</link>
      <description>Where to See African Artists Around the World Right Now Zanele Muholi, Ngwane I , Oslo, 2018 A guide to some of the African artists showing abroad this month and beyond in major shows and group presentations from Berlin to Miami...in case you happen to be there too. Zanele Muholi | Gropius Bau, Berlin | 26 November 2021 - 13 March 2022 Gropius Bau will host Zanele Muholi’s first major survey in Germany. The visual activist has been documenting the life of Black LGBTQIA+ communities in South Africa for close to two decades. The show will encompass the full range of Muholi’s practice from their earlier, lesser-known photographic series to recent work addressing sexual politics, racial violence, communal resistance and self-assertion. “Muholi’s photography is not only a gesture of empowerment, but consistently challenges the heteronormative gaze while building a network of affinity and new pictorial histories. Series such as Faces and Phases and Brave Beauties have contributed to a growing visual archive that celebrates Black queer and trans selfhood, acting as a testimony of those who risk their lives to live authentically in the face of repression and discrimination.” Zanele Muholi, Bona , Charlottesville, 2015. Zanele Muholi | Bildmuseet, Umeå University, Sweden | 27 November 2021 - 8 May 2022 Showing at Bildmuseet at Umeå University in Sweden, this extensive exhibition presents Zanele Muholi’s career as a photographer and visual activist from the early 2000s until today. “In beautiful and striking photographs, Muholi tells the stories of Black LGBTQIA+ lives in South Africa and beyond. Their work includes depictions of love and intimacy as well as intense portraits of people who risk their lives to live authentically despite oppression and discrimination. In the ongoing series Somnyama Ngonyama [Hail the Dark Lioness], Muholi turns the camera on themself. With references to family history and depiction of the black body through the ages, the artist stages themself, over and over again.” Mimi Cherono Ng’ok | Closer to the Earth, Closer to My Own Body | Art Institute Chicago | 18 June 2021 - 7 February 2022 Kenyan photographer Mimi Cherono Ng’ok’s first solo museum show in the US is currently on at the Art Institute Chicago. For ‘Closer to the Earth, Closer to My Own Body’ she presents photographs and a film made across Africa, the Caribbean and South America. Her work is an exploration of how natural environments, botanical cultures and human subjects coexist and evolve together. “Working with an analog camera, Ng’ok travelled extensively across the tropical climates of the Global South constructing a visual archive of images that document her daily experiences and aid her in processing emotions and memories. She tracked flowers and floral imagery across varied contexts—enshrouding the exterior of homes, emblazoned on bedspreads, encountered in nighttime flower markets—and a range of hidden associations. Some of the plants she pictures have been used as love potions or medicines, while others have been moved around the globe as part of histories of imperial or colonial expansion.” Portia Zvavahera | Ndakaoneswa murima | David Zwirner, New York City | 4 November 2021 - 18 December 2021 ‘Ndakaoneswa murima’ is Zimbabwean artist Portia Zvavahera’s first solo exhibition in New York. The title of the show translates from Shona to English as ‘I was made to see the dark side’. The exhibition will include all new works through which she continues to develop her subject matter: joining her dream worlds with her lived experience and daily rituals. “Zvavahera expands her practice with new motifs and narratives, populated by symbolic creatures that become powerful conduits for interpreting her spiritual visions. This body of work also builds upon her interest in combining vibrant color with varied painting and printmaking techniques to produce intricate designs and delicate lacelike patterns across her vast canvases. Zvavahera gives form to emotions that manifest from other realms and dimensions beyond the domains of everyday life and thought. Her vivid imagery is rooted in the cornerstones of our earthly existence—life and death, pain and pleasure, isolation and connection, and love and loss.” Zvavahera joined David Zwirner in 2021. Installation view: Meleko Mokgosi, Your Trip to Africa Meleko Mokgosi | Your Trip to Africa | Pérez Art Museum, Miami | 28 February 2020 - 9 January 2022 Pérez Art Museum in Miami presents a solo exhibition by Botswana-born, New York-based artist Meleko Mokgosi titled ‘Your Trip to Africa’. At its centre is a large-scale, newly commissioned work created for the museum’s 30-foot, double volume project gallery which references the 1966 film Unsere Afrikareise (Our Trip to Africa) by the seminal filmmaker Peter Kubelka. “Mokgosi wields the traditions of Western European painting to deliver sharp political critiques relating to the postcolonial condition. Combining a high degree of painterly skill with a poetic, open-ended semiotic approach and a penchant for deep archival research, the artist shines light on some of the complex socioeconomic dynamics that animate contemporary southern Africa. Whereas traditional history paintings feature lofty subjects—military battles or climactic scenes drawn from ancient legends—Mokgosi elevates everyday, anonymous persons and common objects, setting them against mundane domestic contexts while inserting references that establish an array of subtle yet powerful suggestive effects.” Barthélémy Toguo | Craving for Humanity | Galerie Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, Paris | 7 April 2021 - 5 December 2021 Presented by Fondation Dapper, ‘Craving for Humanity’ is a solo show by Cameroonian artist Barthélémy Toguo in Paris. “Driven by the need to create in order to make statements, he designs works that respond directly to the upheavals of today’s world (wars, abuse of power, immigration, famine and dangers). Using a range of techniques—from drawing, watercolour and sculpture to photography, performance and installation art— Barthélémy Toguo uses a range of techniques to ask us questions about our humanity.” Dale Lawrence | Broken Tools | Nuweland, Oosterzee-Buren, The Netherlands and online | 6 November 2021 - 8 January 2022 South African artist Dale Lawrence’s solo exhibition in The Netherlands, and online, asks: “Can an object exist without communicating anything ?” The exhibition is a selection of works made over the past six years. Yinka Shonibare, Modern Magic (Studies of African Art from the Picasso Collection) X , 2021 Simone Leigh | Eden Seifu | Thebe Phetogo | Thina Dube | Alteronce Gumby | Ryan Huggins &amp; others | W Art Foundation presents Running: The New Contemporary | Qingdao Art Museum, Shandong, China | On view until the 5th of December 2021 W Art Foundation&apos;s current exhibition, &apos;Running&apos;, aims to showcase the cultural and ethnic richness and diversity in global contemporary art. The show, which features over 30 works, includes several African artists, including Thina Dube, Thebe Phetogo and Atanda Quadri Adebayo. Many of the participating artists are showing for the first time in China. &apos;Running&apos; explores the cultural diversity and the array of creative powers of contemporary artists in the post-Internet era, bringing together paintings, sculptures, installations, and video works by established and emerging artists, while focusing mainly on painting. The exhibition will present various styles of painting, from figurative, surrealist, genre, Neo-expressionism, abstract, to conceptual, dadaist and realist. Through presenting artworks that—compared to those in the dominant Western canon—are lesser known to the general public in China, &apos;Running&apos; aims to show a contemporary art history in-the-making, one that is becoming freer, more integrated, and more diversified. The traditional hierarchies and institutionalised stereotypes in art history are seen as broken through by the artists featured in this exhibition. The exhibition is on at the Qingdao City Art Museum in Qingdao from November to December 2021. Atanda Quadri Adebayo, Classicman III , 2021. Acrylic on paper, 91 x 125cm.

      <description>RESHAPE 22 Future Art Histories Contemporary female artists from Africa, reshaping and redefining the art world Reshape is an annual, online survey exhibition that seeks to augment the visibility of contemporary women-identifying artists in Africa. The exhibition envisions a more comprehensive and inclusive art canon for future generations. Presented online by Latitudes Online and ANNA Pure Organic, it aims to highlight powerful women-identifying voices on the continent and empower a collective whose narrative has been underplayed and neglected throughout history, all while still taking intersectional theory into consideration. THEMATIC CURATION Reshape probes what unites the artists by evaluating similarities in their practices and identifying five themes that are prevalent in their work at this current moment. Our 2022 themes include: Materiality covers a broad range of artists, where the materials of their artwork strongly influence and inform their meaning. This theme also draws near to and focuses on the process in which the works are made, and how the softness of materials, processes and creative expression filter into the emotive response we feel as the viewer. Portraiture offers a space of self-defined identity and representation, whether that be self-portraiture or stories of womanhood told by women. The Female Gaze offers a reclamation of power (seen through composition, subject matter and direct eye contact) by women. This theme also touches on spaces where women are still at the mercy of traditional power structures and bodily violences too. Nature and Sustainability centres around works that pertain to the environment, environmental changes, to the cyclical nature of birth and decay as well as works that are organic in their subject matter or materiality. The Body as a Vessel references works associated with the female form and is a soft play of the relation between nature and the body. The body as a vessel also relates strongly to family as sexuality, from the making and birthing of children, and the strong intergenerational connection between mother and daughter.

      <description>Best Beyond The Ages November Modern and Contemporary Live Auction --------------------------------------- To end the year on a high note, Aspire Art Auctions will present an exciting sale of Modern and Contemporary Art this November in Johannesburg. Set to be held at the company’s exquisite new home in the heart of the Rosebank art district, the sale will offer collectors a fresh and carefully curated selection of landmark artworks coveted both for their rarity and artistic excellence. This sale aims to follow on the historic success of the October auction. The brilliantly varied sale offers rarely seen lots of artworks from the earliest edge of modern art history, featuring delicately crafted prints from as early as 1804 by English naturalist and colonial era documentarian Samuel Daniell , along with the recent marvels of contemporary fractal and amoeba-like watercolour explorations of Marcus Neustetter. Highlights of this summer sale include lots lifted from Irma Stern&apos;s golden period. They are a gloriously yellow Still Life with roses, blue bowl and the artist’s brushes in a pot. Estimated at R3.5-4 million, the marvellous painting embodies all the pedigree that has earned Stern renown as South Africa’s most valuable painter. The masterfully painted work is fittingly balanced by the vitality and graceful dexterity of the drawing titled, Woman with Headscarf executed in 1941 while she was traveling through the Eastern Cape. Irma Stern, Still life with roses, blue bowl and the artist&apos;s brushes in a pot, 1936, Oil on canvas George Pemba is a modern master who the market is finally catching up on. Thanks to a stunning exhibition at Cape Town&apos;s Norval Foundation nudging art lovers to take note of his greatness, Pemba’s work has been seeing great success and high demand. Included in the auction is a very rare set of watercolours by Pemba. The lots provide a fantastic insight into his facility as a painter gifted beyond the confirmed medium of oil. Another sure-bet painter, Vladimir Tretchikoff , is represented in this auction with a large oil equestrian study titled Race Horses . Celebrated as the people’s painter, Tretchikoff had found a unique and populist take on art history’s seminal motifs with a knack that earned him the “king of kitsch” moniker. He started painting horse races in the late 1960s and continued with the theme during the 1970s while attending many of the events at Kenilworth racecourse in Cape Town. Those visits inspired Race Horses, depicting competition horses on a calm walk and not in a grand gallop. Alfred Thoba, Fruits of Life , 1990, Oil on board These marvels of modern painting are offered alongside iconic sculptural works, including exceptional and monumental works by Edoardo Villa. Among them is a large dynamic piece produced in 1991 as South Africa was going through the birth pains of a new democratic order. The work is appropriately titled African Throne. Its majestic air finds colourful rhyme with other Villas on the sale – a pair of blazing red and blue painted twin steel works, Interlocking forms (Sylvan) red and blue from1992 . Physically dwarfing all these is a colossal piece from the momentous year of 1976, Three Personages. It can be read as a dark shining modernist monument to another important image that came out of the troubled year – the now famous three figures in the photographic Pietà of Hector Peterson. Along with the colourful iron certainty of Villa, bidders have a chance to catch a much-coveted contemporary constructivist piece by Wim Botha. The work is one of the best examples of why Botha is celebrated for his unparalleled balance of probing philosophical perspective and impeccable artistic technical skill. The attractively priced sculpture comes to market on the back of a ground-breaking exhibition at the Norval Foundation celebrating the artist and placing savvy collectors on notice. Edoardo Villa, Three Personages, 1976, P ainted steel The auction also features a great selection of contemporary works. Among these are the prodigiously gifted colourist Kate Gottgens . Her generation’s answer to tested painterly voices like Stern and Robert Hodgins, Gottgens’ large painting, The Abstractor arrives in the sale fresh from a show at Sydney Contemporary in Australia. Its blazing brilliance finds virtuosic companionship offered alongside a grandiose best of class Asha Zero acrylic on board. Zero’s work is poised to stimulate a growing interest in his unique artistic voice among a new generation of collectors and tastemakers. Collectors have a chance to bid for the largest Simon Stone painting to ever come to the auction. The History of Bush Fires , “perfectly plays up the contrasts between representation and abstraction,” shining light on why William Kentridge refers to Stone as South Africa’s best painter. In contemporary drawing, vitality and virtuosity have no better host than the hands of Phillemon Hlungwani. His magnificent work, You Create Your Own Happiness is a fitting elixir as we begin to shake off the despair of the past two years of covid pandemic. The work is sure to set a new record for the artist. Beezy Bailey, Water on Fire , 2011, Oil and enamel on canvas A further highlight is a series of drawings by Diane Victor. Among the three works on offer is a large-scale piece, There’s Fire in the Thatch , unique in her oeuvre. It&apos;s a rare example of a period when she was using a lot of colour in her work compared to her better known monochromatic prints. Other major drawings include dreamy mythological works by Deborah Bell. They sit well alongside notable drawings by Dumile Feni to complete a compelling art historical picture. Collectors interested in the story of Feni embrace his influence on William Kentridge . There is a great variety of work showcasing the diverse range of his iconic style and artistic voice. Examples are a large poster from Resist the Hour alongside etchings from his Domestic Scenes -Preparations for Hat day and Triumph of Bacchus a monumental work of twenty etchings, each printed on 100% Hemp Phumani handmade paper and mounted on raw cotton cloth.

      <description>Time is suspended in Cinthia Sifa Mulanga’s new editioned works Working on different continents allowed Cinthia Sifa Mulanga and Jillian Ross to generate a considered series of prints that distill the essence of her art. These works will be on show at FNB Art Joburg this weekend. --------------------------------------- Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Intimate, 2022, Direct gravure with photogravure on gampi paper chine collé, Hahnemühle, Natural White, 300gsm, Image Size: 40.6 x 30.2 cm, Paper Size: 51 x 40.5 cm, Edition of 25, R 12,500.00 ex. VAT The process of creating prints is rarely thought of as one that an artist can participate in from afar. Most artists are not only in the studio with Jillian Ross, David Krut’s most acclaimed master printer, but they are hovering behind her watching the process unfold and making decisions about the colour of the paper or processes that will impact the outcome of the final images. Yet when the young Joburg-based artist Cinthia Sifa Mulanga worked with Ross on a trio of prints that are due to be presented at the upcoming FNB Art Joburg she had to do so from afar since Ross found herself unable to leave Saskatoon, Canada, during the height of the pandemic. Like many people whose lives were uprooted during Covid-19, Ross had been forced to find ways to continue working in Saskatoon. One of her major clients, William Kentridge, the renowned South African artist, needed her to remain operational. After locating a printing studio at the University of Alberta, Ross got to work on the project with Kentridge, and then Mulanga. It was as if all the planets were in alignment, for the photogravure process that Ross had been working on – etching photographic images - proved the apt technique to translate the collage element of Mulanga’s practice. This feature of the Congolese-born artist’s work is an expression of her interest in the representation of black women, not only how they are presented in popular culture but also how they shape their identities through photographic self-portraits on social media. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Vulnerable, 2022, Direct gravure with photogravure on gampi paper chine collé, Hahnemühle, Natural White, 300gsm, Image Size: 40.3 x 30.3 cm, Paper Size: 51 x 40.5 cm, Edition of 25, R 12,500.00 ex. VAT Mulanga typically presents a series of black female subjects in domestic settings, which are juxtaposed with images hanging on the walls that relay how women are or have been represented through art. The referential nature of this element of her work makes collage an ideal conduit. The photogravure process pushed this feature further as it allows for the collaged elements to be more seamlessly integrated into the composition. As such, the character of her art has been thoughtfully translated into these editioned works, which will surely be welcomed by collectors, given the demand for her paintings, which often sell before they are completed. Undoubtedly, the demand for Mulanga’s art resides in her interest in the conditions that shape the black female identity. The character of Mulanga’s mark-making comes into sharp focus through her prints. This is no doubt due to Ross’s skill as a printer, but she says it is also the result of the extended period that Mulanga had to create drawings that would later be etched into copper plates. Covid-19 afforded her this time, but also with Ross working on another continent, there was less pressure to generate the drawings immediately. Jillian Ross testing glue in preparation for chine collé (gluing paper), photo by Amber Azcorra-Dahl “Because she was working in her own studio and in her own time, the drawings aren’t forced or laboured. She did a beautiful job. When you&apos;re working in a studio that isn&apos;t yours under somebody else&apos;s timeframe, which happens often when you&apos;re working collaboratively in print studios, it&apos;s from 9 to 5. And in this case, Cinthia just had time. As much time as she needed.” This sense of time affording deep contemplation, and self-reflection is the mood that infuses the trio of prints and is also echoed in the titles assigned to them; Intimate, Vulnerable and Ne lave pas ton visage&apos; (do not wash your face). In contrast to her paintings, these works only present one female subject in a room, though the artworks of other women displayed on the walls summon other subjectivities. In this way, the sense of self-reflection is more tangible. The use of mirrors in two of the prints further enhances this idea of scrutiny but also brings into focus the possibility that the subjects cannot perceive themselves fully – as the mirrors reflect an image that is beyond their line of sight. This suggests there is always an aspect of their physical selves that escapes them. An awareness of this keeps them tethered to the mirror, which promises views of themselves beyond their everyday reach. Mulanga is inspired by social media and how women present themselves through selfies, where the camera lens, the screen and ‘likes’ function as the veritable ‘mirror’. However, as an artist interested in the role the western canon of painting and photography has played in this culture, she references it through the works hanging on the walls but also via the traditional compositions and the classical architectural details of the rooms they occupy. This all works at establishing these scenes as timeless. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga, Ne lave pas ton visage, 2022 Direct gravure etching with Kitakata chine collé, collaged onto Hahnemühle, Natural White, 300gsm paper, 42.5 x 53 cm, Edition of 25, R 15,120.00 ex. VAT This could be driven by two motives that underly Mulanga’s practice; to insert black female subjects into the western canon, but also to draw attention to how female subjects remain the subjects of scrutiny, not only via society’s gaze but their own. This sense of timelessness is supported through the choices Mulanga made in the materials and mediums of the prints. She opted for cream paper and brown-toned inks, according to Ross. The Japanese paper used for the larger work, called Kitakata, has an ‘archival’ look too, which further situates the work as being of another time. In adding texture to the garments and enhancing the collage character that is specific to Mulanga’s practice Ross advised a Chine-collé process, which essentially sees an additional layer of paper bonded to the image. Not that Mulanga was a stranger to the printing process; she trained at the Artist Proof Studio in Joburg, which specialises in printing. The slow back-and-forth nature of the communication between Mulanga and Ross in creating these prints, which saw samples being sent to South Africa for Mulanga to peruse, meant that every decision in the creation of these prints wasn’t rushed. This has ironically, resulted in a series of prints that relay a different, yet full, aspect of Mulanga’s art despite her not being in the room where they were made. - Mary Corrigall is a Cape Town-based commentator, advisor and independent researcher</description>

      <title>Unpicking the value of textile art</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/unpicking-the-value-of-textile-art</link>
      <description>Unpicking the value of textile art Now that the rush to buy textile-based art has somewhat abated those who are making strides with this medium are easier to spot and appreciate. ----------------------------- Screenshot from April Dauscha&apos;s (2013) video work Custody of the Tongue (binding) - showing at Whatiftheworld&apos;s exhibition Indecent curated by Pierre Fouché The perceived interest in portraiture painting has been positive for the development of textile-based art. When textile art was enjoying its time in the African contemporary art market sun, there was an abundance of frankly aimless, raggedy textile works finding their way onto exhibitions and art fairs. It is unfortunate, but often artists (and gallerists) without their own point of view do climb onto ‘trends’ in the art market, often weighing them down with poorly conceived and executed works. This eventually motivates buyers and curators to look to something new to focus their attention. And so, the wheel of the art market turns. As always when acquiring artworks the best time to look at an artist, medium or era is when there is little attention on it, or them. Without a buying frenzy driving up prices, sometimes inflated in relation to the quality of the art, collectors can take their time, considering the works and identifying those that are valuable independent from speculation in the art market. Not that textile art is a flash-in-the-pan trend in art by any means. Textile-based art has been a medium associated with African contemporary art for some time. This isn’t only due to a succession of African artists fashioning hanging works in the style of El Anatsui or manipulating, exploiting West African prints in the manner of Yinka Shonibare, or digging into its ‘storytelling’ function in the manner of Billie Zangewa, but perhaps due to the importance of textiles as conduits of expression in many African cultures, whether indicating status or other societal values. There is a body of study focused on this and many of these important historical cloths reside in museum collections. Pierre Fouché Alpha Thickems, showing at Whatiftheworld&apos;s exhibition Indecent curated by Pierre Fouché, image by Paris Brummer In a sense therefore many contemporary artists are building on or extending this central role of textiles imbuing it and working with its properties. It takes a confident and persistent art collector willing to do a bit of research and get to the bottom of why and how an artist – their motivations will always differ - is working with textiles. For, of course, the intrinsic and sustained value of a textile-based artwork is connected to the artist’s engagement with their medium and why it is not only vital to their expression but would be impossible without it. How would this approach apply to say a William Kentridge tapestry work, given the artist’s core expression is tied to drawing and the filming of drawings? Rendering Kentridge motifs in a tapestry format might add another layer of possibility to his expression, in terms of the formal qualities, the tactility, and perhaps ideologically, positioning it in a western canon of historical storytelling, mythmaking through the tapestry. However, a Kentridge tapestry would unlikely be considered essential to a collection focused on textile art. Primarily this is due to the work not being a product of an engagement with textiles. Gina Waldman, Olympia, 200cm x 100cm, tapestry, threads, pearl pins, 2017, CONTACT TO BUY From this perspective, those artists who shift and change their medium and expression to suit the market or to extend their practice would more or less be excluded from a serious collection. Those artists genuinely interested in working with textiles, cloth or hanging sculptural works now, due to the focus on painting and portraiture, have a less noisy field to plough further and deeper. One such artist doing so with great aplomb in Cape Town right now is Pierre Fouché. He has curated a deliciously naughty exhibition, appropriately titled Indecent, of quasi-pornographic imagery of homosexuals, interpreted via lace and other textile-based mediums. There is also a solo exhibition of much less risqué works in The Seas and all will part, Expire showing at the Spier wine farm near Stellenbosch, which presents works in which Fouché reinterprets historical images, texts and other interesting subjects through his contemporary lace-making. Pierre Fouché Thickems in Flower, showing at Whatiftheworld&apos;s exhibition Indecent curated by Pierre Fouché, image by Paris Brummer Fouché is an ideal example of an artist working with textiles whose art, expression, and technique is woven (pun intended) into his art-making practice. Fouché doesn’t simply work with lace, he makes it. He has spent decades learning the old techniques and it is through doing so that he also came into contact with the cultures, ideas, (and genders of the makers) linked to this textile over time. This has all fed into his contemporary expression using lace as one of his mediums. Fouche works against the grain of his medium – such as in the case of the miniature lace work Alpha Thickems which sees two naked men getting it on. Erotic imagery of two men is not associated with lace – indeed while lace is associated with seduction and romance it rarely is used to depict a sexual act or that between two men. In this way, Fouche radically challenges the culture attached to this textile, but in using it he can position homosexual love and sex as one that is historically rooted and beautiful, not sordid or oversexualized as may be the perceptions some have due to the prevalence of gay porn imagery. Gina Waldman, Pastoral, 200 x 100 cm, tapestry, pearl pins, thread 2017, CONTACT TO BUY Bonola Kavula, who recently won the inaugural Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, doesn’t make the shweshwe fabrics she works with, instead, she mimics the ‘dot’ pattern that defines many of the prints associated with this South African fabric in her abstract ‘reconstructions of it into abstract works. As such she deconstructs shweshwe not only as a print but in so doing, prompts the viewer to reconsider it at a granular level with regards to its social and cultural value - looking beyond the print&apos;s aesthetics so to speak. Screenshot from April Dauscha&apos;s (2013) video work Custody of the Tongue (binding) - showing at Whatiftheworld&apos;s exhibition Indecent curated by Pierre Fouché For this reason, many artists working with textiles are more interested in pulling fabrics apart than weaving them together. Gina Waldman is an example of an artist embracing this approach in her tapestry works in which she reverses the process and the image by presenting the reverse side of a tapestry and working as a result in the reverse – back to front. This makes for a very tactile image with all the messy and loose threads hanging from the surface. This quirky reversal is also filtered through traditional art imagery – such as Édouard Manet’s Olympia or historical maps allowing Waldman to quite literally ‘unpick’ the power and influence of the imagery she works with. South Africa boasts a wealth of artists working with textiles. Kimathi Mofofo who started out painting has found her groove in embroidered works. There are also some interesting newcomers to the scene too such as Abongile Sidzumo, who is working with leather, constructing abstract and configurative works with this material. Undoubtedly, the dominance of figurative art has seen textile artists move away from more abstract compositions, Sidzumo appears to be playing both sides for now. - Mary Corrigall is a Cape Town-based commentator, advisor and independent researcher</description>

      <title>Curator Spotlight: Kimberley Cunningham picks her top three works from Reshape</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/curator-spotlight-kimberley-cunningham-picks-her-top-three-works-from-reshape</link>
      <description>Curator Spotlight: Kimberley Cunningham picks her top three works from Reshape 22 ------------------------------------ Kimberley Cunningham, photo credit: Micha Serraf As a leading expert in Contemporary Art from Africa and the diaspora, Kimberley Cunningham combines her curatorial and advisory roles to create a new model through which to champion art from the continent and beyond. Kimberley graduated as valedictorian of Central Saint Martins (London), specialising in Art Criticism &amp; Curation and upon graduating she worked at Gagosian Gallery (London) followed by Goodman Gallery (Johannesburg, Cape Town &amp; London). In 2020 she went independent and founded Cunningham Contemporary, which uses a collaborative model for both curatorial practice and art advisory services. In February 2021, she initiated a new exhibition model in Johannesburg entitled RESTUDIO, which served as a response to the limitations around viewing art in person through national lockdowns and postponements of art fairs. Working closely with WHATIFTHEWORLD Gallery, AFRONOVA GALLERY and a group of independent artists, the exhibition positioned itself as a three-month project to support creatives and galleries across Southern Africa. Today Kimberley is the Head Curator for the new Singita Art Gallery project, aiming to consciously celebrate African art whilst remaining true to Singita’s conservation roots. The Singita art concept and its expanding programme was born out of a desire to find further ways to support conservation while creating a platform to showcase contemporary art and support artists from across the continent. “We are fortunate through the gallery projects to be custodians of the diverse cultures of Africa and to be able to share these important stories through creative practices,” says Kimberley. Passionate about empowering women in the creative sector, Kimberley is the Founder of WIA Africa (Women in Art Africa), a platform dedicated to support, encourage and mentor art professionals across the continent which is officially launching in early 2023. Q: What you think about the Reshape 22 show as a whole? Do you believe there is a need for an annual survey show of this nature? KC: Having an annual survey like Reshape 22 serves as both a celebration and important catalyst for women-identifying artists, who have historically been overviewed. As a champion of artists from the continent, particularly the extraordinary women within it, I am overjoyed by the efforts of the Latitudes team to create such a powerful platform. There is a collective energy that is palpable through dialogue that the works are able to have amongst each other through a survey of this nature and it is a delight to explore. Kimberley Cunningham&apos;s top three works Each of the three artworks from my selection are an exploration of the physical and non-physical. Rooted by the body or the geographically physical, the three very different artists are challenging the viewer through both their layered meanings and techniques. Following on from the exploration of historical spirituality and religion, Lungile Ngcobo creates ghost-like classical portraits through archival photo montages. The faceless characters appear otherworldly and surreal and the viewer is positioned to carefully unwrap the complex layers of the imagery. The familiarity of the uniforms is displaced within the landscapes and she does not offer us all the answers, which gives the viewers the opportunity to interrogate their own questions. Lungile Ngcobo, Umyalelo Wentliziyo, R 10,000 ex. VAT Having followed Amy Rusch’s work for quite some time, I have always been captured by her meditative repetitive technique of cutting and stitching using thread and plastic bags. Both materials have such a delicate, feminine quality reminiscent of both skin and traditional historically feminine craft. It through her cutting and melding of the two materials together that create a beautiful strength appearing almost as cartographic tattoos on skin. Amy Rusch, Leaf from a dream, 2021, R 15,000 ex. VAT Umseme Uyakhuluma exquisitely captures the celestial energy, of tradition and modernity. This body of work has been formed through a wonderfully collaborative practice made up of women photographers, videographers and creatives spearheaded by Zana Masombuka. I’m so excited by this type of co-creation and have seen incredible examples of this across the continent. I&apos;m looking forward to watching it evolve and push the boundaries of artistic practice. Umseme Uyakhuluma, UMSEME UYAKHULUMA XV, R 20,000 ex. VAT</description>

      <description>The Melrose Gallery presents Jean-David Nkot&apos;s solo show Corps de P@ges ---------------------------- Jean David Nkot, fr.cm.body in boby.gmail.com, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY 1465 | The Other’s Face Words by Simon Njami on Jean-David Nkot&apos;s Corps de P@ges Jean-David Nkot is above all, at least for the moment, a painter. His work, even when it contains elements of abstraction, is essentially figurative, obsessed with the body and its representation. The black body, is it necessary to specify it. Even if this famous “black body” may appear as an old story, maybe should we explore Nkot’s position a bit deeper. Nkot, since his first canvases, paints and depicts himself. In a camouflaged, metaphorical way, but with a confused desire to create an autobiography of the possible. The important thing is not that he appears conspicuously in his paintings, but that his paintings carry a bit of this story that Nkot seeks to untie. This story has Africa as its background, whether present or suggested. In previous works, he questioned the nature of displacement in its most contemporary and political expression, which is migration. Recent history has shown young teenagers who, embarking for a hypothetical, illusory and artificial promised land, have completed their journey at the bottom of the oceans and seas. For those who have managed to maintain a meaningless life, another adventure, perhaps even more traumatic than the first, began: that of the foreigner, the renegade, the refugee. The aborted dream they carried inside them has shrunk to a trickle and here they are, confronted with the sad reality of exile and identity questioning. In this quest for meaning and this questioning of territory and belonging, Nkot deliberately moved his characters to install them in hostile territories, far from their original environment. The obvious fragility he was expressing then was that of the gaze of the other, of the relationship to oneself and to one’s humanity: this discrepancy inherent in human nature which opposes the way in which we are perceived to the way in which we perceive ourselves. Psychological tearing refers to the notion of uprooting, even alienation. It was an illustration of a global evidence that does not concern, far from it, only the children of Africa. It is Friday’s experience that, in a Hegelian paradox, restores to Robinson an awareness of his own being. If, as Lacan said, we exist only through thegaze of the other, the gaze of the “strongest” often sends us back to our weakness by reinforcing it in its illusion of power. Jean David Nkot, Po.Box. cold look, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY In this new series, the gaze becomes clearer. The organic foreigner that is the migrant gives way to another form of strangeness, more subtle and cruel and which South Africans have had the outrageous experience of: being a stranger to oneself, or, in to be more precise, to be a stranger where everything would lead us to believe that we are at home. I mentioned the migrants who came to South Africa and were victims of xenophobia from those who participated to their freedom, but the strangeness that Nkot addresses also appears in the countries from which the characters described come from. This is no longer a racial strangeness, but a social divide. In speaking of the foreigner, I invoke two ontologically contradictory notions: that of the foreigner who frightened Plautus (Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit) and which we have just briefly covered and that of the maverick used by James Baldwin to define himself and also, why not, at Camus’ Meursault. Baldwin defined himself as a maverick and Meursault, Camus’ character as an «stranger», because neither matched what their communities expected of them. The Anglo-Nigerian photographer Rotimi Fani-Kayodé defined himself as an outsider. But these last examples, even if they evoke an intra-community misunderstanding, cannot apply to the characters portrayed by Nkot. The latter find themselves rejected even beyond the community of which they are a part and therefore, nothing is expected of them. A strange character, as Plautus could have said, is an uprooted person without any identifiable attachment. We could, in other circumstances, have used these same terms to define freedom, since the principle that governs the latter is precisely the fact of not being accountable to anyone. This is an enviable position. I’ve always suspected the notion of “ roots”, which seems to be coming back into fashion. I no longer know what those who use and abuse it mean. The root is now inseparable from race, nation, homeland... As if it were not a random occurrence but a kind of certificate of origin that we oppose to the “Other”. W.E.B. Dubois who announced the color line as an essential issue of the twenty-first century, was he wrong? The color or the origin (since now the two merge) has become a vector of tension, despite the gray areas it implies, since there is no absolute color, but aggregates, mixtures. And each to throw his roots in the face of the other. What do the roots tell us if we think about it, if not an underground movement invisible to the eye and whose ramifications are of infinite complexity. The impoverishment of discourse for personal, individual, community ends invalidates any debate which is de facto, reduced to the zero degree of thought. Appropriations and reappropriations, recriminations, demands for a rewriting of history constitute a formless chaos of dissonant noises. Jean David Nkot, instant de reflexion.com Acrylique, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY The stranger portrayed in Nkot’s latest series doesn’t have to be burdened with all that ideological jumble. He does not care about the gaze of the other who crosses him without seeing him. He does not need to forge a fake identity since he belongs to the land on which he lives. He is part of this community that we call Nation. This identity, official, legal, cannot be refused to him. The identity denied to him is of a completely different nature: it is that of his personality, of his persona. An identity, I use this word deliberately to oppose it to the notion of national identity, which owes nothing to anyone but is the result of a constant work on oneself that Jung called individuation. It is necessary, in the alchemical process described by the psychoanalyst, to succeed in getting rid of all the rags that constituted us in order to forge, in the athanor of our mind, a new personality. So as to fully embody what Heidegger will call Dasein, “being-in-the-world”). The characters described by Nkot are deprived of their «dasein», they are invisible humans, to use the word Ralph Ellison, who described the situation of black Americans during the years of segregation in the United States: social invisibility, political invisibility, legal invisibility… But the invisibility that opposes, in Ellison, blacks and whites takes on another accent when it comes to individuals of the same race. These cannot even count as pariahs (which would still represent a form of identity) since their lives and their actions are not acknowledged in the evolution of the society they inhabit. They are not invisible, they are anonymous: “In evoking the anonymity of this existence, I am not thinking at all of this indeterminate background that we talk about in philosophy manuals and where perception cuts things up. This indeterminate ground is already a being – a been – a something. It already falls into the category of the noun. He already has that elementary personality which characterizes all existing.” Levinas, like Jung, mentions the importance of this personality without which, as soon as we are deprived of it, we are nothing. And it is on this «primal personality» that Nkot’s gaze lingers. Suddenly, his brush gives them back the human dimension they are denied. Most of the time his subjects look at him. They face him, as if they were posing for a photograph, a testimony to come. Time is stopped, the space of this moment when, suddenly, they come back to life. The accessories with which they surround themselves, or with which the artist adorns them, are only accessories, often the same ones, which come to insist on the derisory, anecdotal side of what these makeshift tools represent in our century of high technology. We will not say that they are proud. They are, and this is already essential. In rereading the quote from Lévinas, I stop for a moment on this “indeterminate background” which is mentioned in reference to philosophy manuals and where “perception cuts things up”. Jean David Nkot, www.hope.com, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY Observing Nkot’s paintings, it is this same sensation that seizes me: his perception cuts out things, in this case, beings, and the indeterminate background on which he inscribes them adds a dreamlike side to this non-place that the characters inhabit. But whatever his primary intention may have been, the artist escapes, through this abstraction of the decor, a misery that would have been out of place here. Two essential moments of this particular human condition are depicted: innocence, perhaps lost, and fatigue. Ordinary fatigue, the one you can experience after hard work but which suddenly takes on apocalyptic overtones: this man on whose shoulders three comrades are placing an excessively heavy load, this child collapsed on sacks, these three pieta supporting a form of which we do not know whether it is a dead or a living person, and these entangled bodies, fallen into the field of labor. The body returns. But it is nothing more than an inert mass, emptied of all energy. But let’s leave these bodies aside to come back to the faces. “This face exposed to my gaze is disarmed. Whatever the countenance he gives himself, whether this face belongs to an important character, labeled or seemingly simpler. This face is the same, exposed in its nudity. Beneath the countenance he gives himself all his weakness breaks through and at the same time his mortality emerges. So much so that I may want to liquidate it completely, why not? However, this is where all the ambiguity of the face lies, and of the relationship to the other. This face of the other, without recourse, without security, exposed to my gaze in its weakness and its mortality, is also the one that orders me: “Thou shalt not kill”. The disarmed face of a raped innocence, of an aborted childhood is what we find ourselves confronted with. In a style that borrows from a certain realism without however completely inhabiting it, by this decor which would correspond well to the word utopia invented by Thomas Moore (and which means no place, or nowhere), Nkot creates a world outside the world. A metaphorical parenthesis. There is no compassion in these paintings (that would have betrayed a position of superiority), but compassion. There is this look that confronts ours. Which challenges us to pass without seeing. Which drives into our consciousness a truth that, perhaps, we would have preferred to avoid. And to come back to the theory of the self-portrait, I cannot get rid of the intuition that Nkot paints his characters as he could have painted himself. But in order to avoid any confusion, it is important to look beyond the obvious. In the same way that the backgrounds are ethereal, these characters are only metaphors, beings without physical consistency and without real location. They seem to be African, maybe the children of the victims of the xenophobic episodes that shook South Africa, but maybe they are Syrians, Ukrainians, Chinese, Black Americans, Palestinians… Nkot, whatever may be chosen geography, could have been one of them. He is one of them. They are all him. Jean David Nkot, portrait For more info and The Melrose Gallery viewing room, click here .</description>

      <description>PEBOFATSO MOKOENA FEATURED IN MUNICH RE OF AFRICA COLLECTION ---------------------- Latitudes is thrilled to share with you our latest collaboration between Munich Re of Africa, Waldman Studios, David Krut Projects and artist, Pebofatso Mokoena. By supporting mid-career, local artists such as Mokoena, Munich Re of Africa continues its ethos of supporting diverse forms of local artistic expression, at grass-roots level. Munich Re of Africa is a subsidiary of Munich Re AG, with headquarters in Munich, Germany. The large scale artwork, currently on loan to Munich Re of Africa, sees two mixed media drawings by Pebofatso Mokoena, Unfamiliar Heartbreak and Rainbow Tunnels , reimagined through an interplay with mirrors. Pebofatso Mokoena was born in Alberton in 1993. His work has received early recognition and is on display in numerous private collections. Central to the South African painter and printmaker&apos;s practice is a fascination with space, energy and movement. Mokoena’s interest lies in the entangled organisations of how organic and man-made geographies shape multiple environments. Through interdisciplinary practices, Mokoena uses his own personal narratives and a consistent application of experimental enquiry as tools to make sense of the chaotic integratedness of the current world he lives in. This reflective artwork is a collaboration between the artist, master printmaker David Krut, Waldman Studios and Latitudes Online, the largest online marketplace for art from Africa. The artwork is given a new interpretation by combining it with a mirrored surface, thus inviting the viewer to enter the collective consciousness of Mokoena&apos;s imagined world and move between two paradigms in an almost out-of-body experience. About Munich Re Group Works of art accompany Munich Re staff, clients and guests not only in corridors, foyers, conference rooms, offices and meeting points, but even in stairwells and underground passages in Munich. Current artistic positions and themes of contemporary art are displayed in temporary exhibitions. The Munich Re Art Collection comprises more than 3,000 works by international artists – from paintings, photographs, drawings and sculptures, all the way to architectural installations. It is Munich Re’s intention and motivation to integrate the diversity of forms of artistic expression into the work environment. The collection is constantly being expanded with contemporary artworks, including, in particular, works by young contemporary artists. The beginnings It all began in 1912/13 with the construction of the Main Building at Königinstrasse in Munich. Besides having a keen instinct for insurance, Carl von Thieme, the founder of Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft (Munich Re), also had an equally sophisticated taste for the art of his time. Thieme commissioned artists from the region to create works for the new company’s headquarters. To this day, the roughly 20 sqm fresco by Reinhold Max Eichler depicting the dramatically staged Kampf der Elemente (Battle of the Elements) still makes an impact in the staircase leading from the entrance area. With Munich Re’s development into a globally operating Group, the art has also become more international. Without setting any specific thematic or formal focus, since the mid-1990s the Munich Re Art Collection’s approach to collecting has followed the current trends in international contemporary art. Art and architecture For Munich Re, the link between art and architecture is of great importance and a key component of the collection profile – and not only in its early days. As the Company grew, new possibilities for dialogue between art and architecture continually opened up. To date, more than 60 site-specific artworks have been created.</description>

      <description>The Artists&apos; Press presents new prints by artist Nabeeha Mohamed ----------------------- Nabeeha Mohamed in studio, courtesy The Artists&apos; Press Nabeeha Mohamed was born in Cape Town in 1988. She completed her fine arts degree at Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town. Her paintings and prints confront the contradictions of her position in post-Apartheid South African society. Her identity as a woman of colour, hushed during her childhood to assimilate into white society, is celebrated in her work where colour and strangeness shine. Her bright brush strokes and sharp words are at once playful and thoughtful. They create a moving and complex critique of class privilege and the capitalist economy she benefits from. Nabeeha Mohamed was the first artist to work in person at The Artists’ Press after the Covid pandemic. Her presence in the studio and her prints are a real celebration of getting back to &quot;normal&quot;. She has held several solo exhibitions and has participated in group shows from Cape Town to Lagos, Accra, New York and London as well as doing residencies in Brazil, South Africa and Ghana. About each work &quot;I have long been in the practice of making notes when I read - writing down words, phrases and even long paragraphs that can sometimes inspire imagery and ideas in my work or, as in the case of ‘Velvet Juice’, assist with my own writing or titling. The text in this lithograph is a collage of phrases from two of my favourite books: Salman Rushdie’s ‘Midnight’s Children’ and Toni Morrison’s ‘Beloved.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed 2022 Nabeeha Mohamed, Velvet Juice, R 6,500 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY &quot; Earnest Fashionista was the first lithograph I made during my residency with the Artist’s Press. I’ve come to realise that many of my self portraits are better described as me in character, or in an alter-ego state. The canon of the self portrait allows for creativity and morphing in my identity, ‘Earnest Fashionista’ being a somewhat subtle transformation into an it-girl fashion figure who excudes a coolness foreign to my everyday self.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed, 2022 Nabeeha Mohamed, Earnest Fashionista, R 6,500 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY &quot;Much of my work is interested in classism and ‘After-Party’ is a depiction of class through a pop-lens. Loosely based on a paparazzi shot of Kendell Jenner on the red carpet, the moody colour pallet and sunglasses give this party girl an edge of mystery and coolness, granting her presence at the after-party, typically considered an exclusive event one needs to be personally invited to.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed, 2022 Nabeeha Mohamed, After Party, R 6,500 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY &quot; Trendy is about a young woman who has too many options in life and so, decides to take them all.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed, Trendy, R 6,500 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY &quot; Kitten features a pair of red tiger-striped boots that by drawing, I hope will somehow be manifested into my wardrobe. I’m not sure whose sexy legs I have drawn here but sadly I cannot claim them as my own.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed, 2022 Nabeeha Mohamed, Kitten, R 3,500 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY &quot;Like most of my still life works, this is an imagined one: the vessel drawn first and then flower by flower added, the previous instigating the creation of the next. I imagine bringing this bouquet home from a market on a late summery Saturday morning. I take time to arrange it in a vessel gifted to me by a dear friend, before placing it on the kitchen table, viewable from my outside reading nook where I will lazily be paging through my book between cat naps for the rest of the afternoon.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed, 2022 Nabeeha Mohamed, Happy Days, R 3,500 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY &quot;When drawing this, Mark asked me “Where is Balenciaga?” which made me realise that life would be a lot better and simpler if Balenciaga were a small town in Spain and not a luxury fashion house the vast majority of the world population cannot afford. This piece forms part of my ongoing “flower girl” series, each flower signalling social commentary on varying aspects of womanhood.&quot; Nabeeha Mohamed, 2022 Nabeeha Mohamed, Funeral Fahionista, R 3,500 ex.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/micha-serraf-at-the-investec-cape-town-art-fair</link>
      <description>RADAR | Micha Serraf at ICTAF’s TOMORROWS/TODAY section with C24 Gallery ------------ DON’T MISS: Micha Serraf (b. 1994, Zimbabwe) will be presenting with C24 Gallery (New York, USA) in the Investec Cape Town Art Fair’s TOMORROWS/TODAY section; this runs concurrently with their duo presentation with Abi Salami at the gallery in New York, titled Impossible Things . Micha Serraf, Tebah, 2021, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY Micha Serraf’s practice is centred around rewriting the trauma of displacement with the imagined memory of celebration, homage and childlike wonder. In pursuit of memory, identity and a place to call home, their work is grounded in a nostalgia of personal and ancestral experience, of what never was, and of what could have been. Caught in an entanglement between ancestral history and utopian optimism, Serraf’s work is often informed by memories they have from when they were a child in Zimbabwe and their endeavour to understand the deep nostalgia that they feel toward the seemingly unfamiliar. To push a more celebratory narrative that is fuelled by the unshakable belief in an abundance, where the often-imposed political narrative takes second seat to that of our lived experience. Of their presentation, Serraf writes: ‘Navigating post-apartheid South Africa as an alien renders many of my experiences surreal. The foreign nature, of both the socio-political and physical landscapes of South Africa, is continuously reinforced by the actions, reactions and interactions I have while on South African soil. Being constantly reminded by the world that I am of alien origin has led me to investigate this side of myself. My work is informed by memories I have from when I was a child in Zimbabwe and my endeavour to understand the nostalgia I feel toward the unfamiliar. In an attempt to figure out what I am and where I belong - I will continue to make visual my memories, thoughts and narratives. Micha Serraf, What is here is what is here, 2021, Wool and cotton needlepoint tapestry, 38 x 58 cm, Image courtesy of the artist Christa Dee wrote about my work saying: “We are each involved in a lifelong theatrical show. We each play multiple roles, constructing, interpreting and negotiating various social parameters. The end goal of this performance being the amalgamation of meaning-making, shared connection and belonging.” As a child in Zimbabwe, there was a purity and innocence of self and other that was open to every horizon of human potential. I want to recreate the elysium of childhood. These artworks are at the same time an exploration of the personal conflict surrounding origin, cultural and racial identity that seek to enclose upon the horizons of human potential, and a meditation on the human condition. I want to explore the precarious vulnerability of being human. I want to meditate on the experience of difference and being “Not Of Here”, on the vastness of the fragile interior, of the home we are forced to carry around with us. To plant roots in shifting and unsettled sand. To go or to stay. To be or to become. To assimilate or to create and redefine. A meditation on the constant conflicts of growth.’ Micha Serraf, Midzi yedu, 2021, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY Serraf was selected as one of thirty finalists for the 2023 Norval Sovereign African Art Prize. In 2021, they were awarded the Ritzau Art Prize and they were selected as the winner of FOAM Museum’s 2020 Top Talent. In 2019, Micha Serraf was awarded the International Pride Best Single Image.</description>

      <title>Photography, not quite mainstream, is always emerging, always surprising</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/photography-not-quite-mainstream-is-always-emerging-always-surprising</link>
      <description>Photography, not quite mainstream, is always emerging, always surprising - By Sean O’Toole David Goldblatt, Saturday Morning at the Hypermarket, Semi-Final of the Miss Lovely Legs Competition, 28 June 1980. Courtesy The Goodman Gallery &amp; David Goldblatt Legacy Trust It is perpetually summer and winter with photography from South Africa, the news both good and bad, all at once. On the upside, there is much to be enthused by. A new generation of photographers, among them Tatenda Chidora, Lebohang Kganye and Lindokuhle Sobekwa, are exhibiting widely, publishing well-received books and winning prestigious awards. Sobekwa, 28, is especially blazing a trail. In January, Johannesburg-based Sobekwa received the inaugural John Kobal Foundation Fellowship, a major new art prize awarded biannually to an artist or collective who for “an outstanding body of lens-based work”. Sobekwa will be London next week (30 March) to deliver his fellowship lecture at Tate Modern, the same institution that in 2020 hosted the first major UK survey of visual activist Zanele Muholi. Sobekwa is currently showing work in Johannesburg with his hero, documentarian Ernest Cole. Against the Grain at Goodman Gallery is an intergenerational exhibition of photography that also features David Goldblatt, Ruth Motau and Ming Smith. The exhibition coincides with a South African roadshow to promote a new edition of Cole’s seminal 1967 photobook, House of Bondage . Zanele Muholi, MuMu XIX, London, 2019 A scrupulous exegesis of black life in apartheid South Africa, New York-based Aperture Foundation recently reissued House of Bondage in a new edition that includes a chapter of never-before-seen photographs of black creative expression and cultural activity taking place under apartheid. A4 Arts Foundation in Cape Town will host a book launch on 23 March. Equally encouraging, veteran photographer Roger Ballen has opened a new private museum in Forest Town, Johannesburg. Designed by architect Joe van Rooyen of JVR Architects, The Inside Out Centre for the Arts will fly the flag of contemporary African photography courtesy of Ballen’s longstanding association with the Eiger Foundation in Switzerland. Ballen has been a keen promoter of photography, in the past sponsoring exhibitions by visiting photographers Stephen Shore and Vik Muniz at public museums in Johannesburg and Cape Town, as well as underwriting seminars to advance the criticism of photography. T atenda Chidora, Self Isolation I, 2020, from the series &apos;If Covid Was A Colour&apos;, winner of Portrait of Humanity Volume 5 At face value, things appear buoyant. But a lacklustre market for print sales weighs heavily on the doings of photographers. Sales, it is quietly whispered, have been tepid since 2020. These anecdotal remarks are backed up by hard data. Research conducted by Irish consultancy Arts Economics on the global art and antiques market in 2021 found that the bulk of the estimated $34.7 billion generated from global sales in the dealer sector came from the more traditional mediums of paintings, sculptures and works on paper. Photography only accounted for 5% of total sales. Photography has always been something of an outlier collectable in South Africa, its orphan status reaffirmed at the recent Cape Town Art Fair. Of the more than 50 exhibitors, only three committed budget to go-for-broke solo presentations of editioned prints by Philippe Koudjina (Thomarts Gallery), Johno Mellish (THK Gallery) and Lunga Ntila (BKhz Gallery). Other dealers, mindful of the lacklustre market for photography, presented new work by Nicola Brandt (Guns &amp; Rain) and Tony Gum (Christopher Moller Gallery) in mixed presentations of stable artists. So how did these plucky dealers fare? Ntila’s photo-collages, now a rarity following her premature death in 2022, were mostly presold. BKhz Gallery’s art fair presentation partly served as a posthumous tribute and featured work traded in Ntila’s 2021 exhibition God Among Us . A week after the fair, auction house Strauss &amp; Co realised R35,175 for a 2019 self-portrait by Ntila published in a single edition, with two additional artist’s proofs. A bargain price, all things considered. Lebohang Kganye, Staging Memories, 2022, detail of installation for award show for Images Vevey Switzwerland Photo Emilien Itim Brandt’s two interlinked bodies of work Fire and Physical Energy , both made in the environs of Rhodes Memorial circa the catastrophic fire that engulfed Table Mountain and the University of Cape Town in 2021, generated “several sales,” according to dealer Julie Taylor. “Local visitors, including a fire-fighter couple who had helped quell the blaze of April 2021, could immediately relate to their own geographic environment and in turn to its history, both political and ecological,” says Taylor, who has opened a new Johannesburg space in Parkhurst. Brandt’s photos were priced between R26,200 ($1,470) and R69,000 ($3,880), depending on size, and were offered in an edition size of five plus one artist’s proof. Black-and-white prints by Koudjina, a respected independence-era photographer who favoured scenes of conviviality in Niger’s capital Niamey, were priced at R23,000 (€1,162). The edition size was limited to ten prints. Ngulube reported satisfactory sales, but is still following up with “cautious spenders” and those “not well versed on the value of photography”. Reviving a debate around colour photography in the 1990s, Ngulube speculated that black-and-white photos put off collectors, in part due to their association with historical news images of “struggles and protests”. Black-and white prints from Mellish’s new essay Wild Natural Setting , an impressionistic juxtaposition of found and composed scenes set along the Garden Route, struggled to find buyers. Offered in an edition of eight, the uniformly large prints were priced at R42,000 ($2,250) each. Emboldened by the favourable critical response to Mellish’s work, THK Gallery is considering returning to Paris Photo in November with his work. The recent uneven trade in Cape Town, while hardly catastrophic, recalls some of the complications and nuances that underpinned the remarkable upsurge in interest in South African photography after 2000, both locally and internationally, institutionally as well as at market. David Goldblatt, who died in 2018, was a leading figure in this tidal upsurge. A closer look at his later career offers a case study in the contradictions underpinning the market for collectable photography. David Goldblatt, Self-portrait at Consolidated Main Reef Mines, Roodepoort, May 1967 In 1998, at the age of 67, Goldblatt presented a solo exhibition of 40 architecturally themed works at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It was the first such achievement by a South African artist. Bigger surveys soon followed, notably Fifty-One Years (2002), which featured 220 photographs produced between 1948 and 1999. Originated in Spain, the travelling exhibition was co-curated by Okwui Enwezor, who included Goldblatt’s new colour work in his watershed documenta 11, also in 2002. The art market was quick to respond. In 2002, the Goodman Gallery hosted a solo exhibition of new and old work by Goldblatt. The presentation included vintage black-and-white prints depicting views of Soweto and District Six, some of them one-off vintage prints. The vintage work was priced below R20,000 ($1,100). Goldblatt’s work now routinely trades at upwards of R365,000 ($20,000) in the primary market, and regularly exceeds that value in the secondary market. Lindokuhle Sobekwa, Death of George Floyd, 2020, inkjet print on Baryta paper Courtesy Goodman Gallery Sustained demand for Goldblatt’s photos is a relatively new phenomenon. A 2009 exhibition of new prints from Goldblatt’s seminal essay In Boksburg (1982), hosted by Stevenson in Cape Town, generated not a single sale to a South African collector. “It is extraordinary, South Africans don’t have a clue,” Michael Stevenson told me at the time. Contrast this apathy with the R432,440 paid in November 2021 for a circa 2009 print depicting a group of white contestants in a beauty pageant photographed by Goldblatt at Boksburg Hypermarket in June 1980. “I think a lot of it is a price perception,” remarked Stevenson in 2009 of the deep bias against photography among South African collectors. “How can a so-called edition be worth that amount of money? They are prejudiced to paper works in any realm, and then there is just the visual literacy. What has happened in photography in the last 20, 30 years internationally has gone past us and never been part of our realm.” Attitudes seemed to shift in the 2010s. Well-established press photographers like Jodi Bieber, Santu Mofokeng and Guy Tillim forged viable gallery careers. Photographers Hasan and Husain Essop, Pieter Hugo, Mikhael Subotzky and Nontsikelelo “Lolo” Veleko all clinched the Standard Bank Young Artist Award, an important early-career accolade. Muholi outpaced them all, becoming a bona fide global art superstar, particularly after the launch of their Somnyama Ngonyama series of darkly toned self-portraits in the mid-2010s. Roger ballen, Threat, 2010 And then the photo wave crashed. Marquee galleries no longer represent Bieber, Veleko and the Essop brothers. Muholi, who recently ended their long association with Stevenson, is now exploring sculpture and will present a social project – a connect-the-dots workbook aimed at children – at Expo Chicago in April, in association with Southern Guild. Crash? Really! While trade in photography has hardly come to a standstill, and new talent continues to astonish, photography has experienced a noticeable downturn in perception and performance. A medium that only a handful of years ago seemed an assured calling card for South African artists looking to make a big splash, both at home and abroad, photography has noticeably spluttered. Jurors of the Standard Bank Young Artist Award have shied away from artists working with photography. Collector interest has decisively coalesced around figure painting. Cinga Samson, a self-taught painter who studied photography at the Stellenbosch Academy and uses photography to orchestrate his fantastical portraits, far outsells Muholi by value. The conspicuous pivot back to painting – a singular artefact that is alienated through its sale and cannot be re-editioned, only made anew – is perhaps best understood as the reassertion of an entrenched hierarchy. Painting is king, and photography is back where it has always been: on the margin, not quite mainstream, always emerging, always surprising, always due a revival.

      <description>Collecting Art: A guide to finding the next big artist Are you looking to discover new, exciting artists? Many collectors and art enthusiasts seek the advice of experts when it comes to finding emerging artists with great potential, but the key to this is often about redefining what ‘potential’ means. - By Mary Corrigall -------------- OpenStudios.Joburg. Photo by: Sara Hallatt, courtesy of META foundation Which artists are you watching at the moment? It’s hard to escape this question when people find out that you analyse the art market, assist collectors, and have worked as an art critic. Everyone is looking for an insider’s tip. They want the name or names of artists that no one has heard of yet and whose work has barely seen the inside of a white cube but is likely to be destined for an international career. So, for all the attention artists represented by top-tier or internationally-based galleries may appear to attract, often the buzz in the art world centres on those inchoate talents that are unfurling on the sidelines. The veritable ‘emerging’ artist has a curious gravitational pull on even the most disinterested art collector, for there are few people who don’t harbour a fantasy of buying an artwork that will one day furnish them with a deposit for a luxury car, even if they have a capacious garage lined with expensive cars. As such, tracking down emerging artists with great future potential (in financial terms) is the holy grail of collecting art at any level. As I have written elsewhere and concretised in the SA Art Market: Patterns &amp; Pricing , emerging artists are not an homogenous category. They can be separated into at least five distinct, though not mutually exclusive categories: the recently graduated, the young established (under 35 years and numerous group or a few solo exhibitions under their belts), the mid-career (over 35 – who often work in other jobs while making art), late-career (over 60), and self-taught. In my analysis of patterns of pricing pertaining to artists in these groups, I found that the prices for established young artists opposed to, say, some mid-career artists could often hit a higher price threshold – in the primary market that is – often this value does not translate into the auction market. The logic underpinning this is that a young established artist is producing work that shows potential, is not as rough around the edges as that being produced by recent graduates, and they have a career ahead of them that could potentially prove meteoric. Realistically, this is only the case for a lucky few who happen to stumble on a form of expression that the market is receptive to. Themba Sibeko, The Blue Life II, R 20,500.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY The largest category of artists – not only in SA but in other studies of artists – are mid-career ones. These artists might be less likely to become famous overnight, but many have. Think of Billie Zangewa – she had been toiling away on her fabric collages almost until her early forties before her work found real traction (in Europe). The quality of work a mid-career artist produces tends to be higher, as they have been refining their techniques and vocabulary, and evolving their interests. Of course, there are those whose art has not evolved at all – they have been circling the same themes rendered in a vocabulary that hasn’t found a groove – or conversely, as with some mid-career artists, they flit from one medium to another, never really finding an aesthetic or subject matter that resonates. Ultimately, an exciting art collection consists of works that are related to each other – that share narrative links, whether around the medium, process, or subject matter, and not one that is guided by speculation or financial gain. There are far too many higgledy-piggledy collections out there with mediocre works by either ‘big-name’ artists or emerging artists who were tipped to make it big. These kinds of artworks are hard to sell on - for obvious reasons. As such collecting with purpose from early on is vital. As an African American collector recently put it, “I collect narratives, not art”. That is a sound guiding principle. In practice, of course, it means having an intimate grasp of an artist’s story about themselves, their work. OpenStudios.Joburg. Photo by: Sara Hallatt, courtesy of META foundation The best way to pursue this approach to collecting art involves attending gallery walkabouts – which are so poorly attended – and making numerous studio visits and engaging directly with artists. This direct approach is far better than your understanding of their work being mediated via an art dealer or an artist statement written by a Michaelis graduate au fait with all the latest fashionable terms being bandied about in academia. Open studio events are ideal for perusing art and chatting with artists without too much pressure. The OpenStudios.Joburg event created and marketed by Sara Hallatt of META foundation that will take place at the end of May to coincide with the RMB Latitudes Art Fair presents an ideal opportunity to engage with emerging artists in Joburg. This year’s May event will include 9 artist studio buildings that include: Bag Factory Artists’ Studios, Lilian Road Studios, Play Braamfontein, Transwerke, Asisebenze, August House, Ellis House, Living Artists Emporium and Victoria Yards. In truth, you will find that many of the artists with studios in these buildings are often making quite similar art – working close to each other appears to engender this. Many artists working from these buildings are self-taught and the quality can be uneven, so you do need to wear a pair of comfy trainers to get through all the studios until you find the artists and works that catch your eye or the story that resonates with your life experience. Foluso Oguntoye, (What money can&apos;t buy), 2020, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY As always, it is more pleasurable (and less tedious) to peruse art by emerging artists that have already gone through a (quality) filter of sorts and is ‘curated’ or are made in response to a curatorial prompt. The Rupert Museum in Stellenbosch, which recently launched its satellite museum the Jan Rupert Centre in Graaf Reinet, presented an interesting curated selection of works by emerging artists, which was the result of a call out to artists to submit works responding to the ‘Art of a Space Age’ theme. This related to a 60s space-age aesthetic and formed the inspiration for works by 39 emerging artists – though at different stages of their careers. The works shown at the In Response: Art of the Space Age , were perhaps more design-driven than conceptual - due to the theme - or perhaps totally reflective of that artist’s practice. Undoubtedly, there is a trend at the bottom end of the local art market that sees works united or ‘filtered’ according to their appearance – visual character. No doubt this relates to how Instagram has shaped our consumption of imagery, but also the Covid-19 pandemic that forced everyone to buy art from PDF catalogues or other online portals. In such contexts where the artists – people in general – are at a remove – the main selling point is the quality of the flat image and the surface interest it generates. OpenStudios.Joburg. Photo by: Sara Hallatt, courtesy of META foundation The Fourth, an experimental design-art gallery, has recently opted for more PDF curated group shows (instead of physical shows) and launched their new ‘drop’ – Post Fair Blue$. This catalogue was brimming with works by emerging artists all under R10 000 in an effort to ‘democratise’ not only who gets to consume art but who gets to sell it too, they claimed. Interestingly, and perhaps in reference to the title of this new ‘drop’ the catalogue reads like an art fair or an Instagram feed in the sense that you are presented with no context about the works or artists – just a long succession of images (with size, price information). This advocates somewhat of a different approach to collecting work by emerging artists than I would embrace – where context and narrative are essential. Just as at an art fair – every manner of expression is available – from abstract to figurative works, photographic to collage, expressive, surreal, and illustrative. This underscores the notion that there is no prevailing ‘movement’ in art – despite the claims that in response to the proliferation of figuration and portraiture, more abstract work is being made. Plurality is the cornerstone of contemporary art, after all. This offers artists the freedom to express themselves in any medium or mode that suits them, but collectors are also unburdened by any prescriptive ideals. Just as there is no insider&apos;s list of which emerging artists to collect there is no prevailing must-have mode of expression. Contemporary art is not rooted in such solid ground, but in constantly shifting sands that blow with the wind. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based researcher, advisor and commentator.</description>

      <description>Innovative technology makes professional art tools accessible Milan-based Artshell is an art software development company that specialises in archiving and managing collections of artworks. The Covid-19 pandemic not only gave them new purpose but drove more innovation that would benefit art dealers and art fairs. - By Mary Corrigall --------------- Image Courtesy: Artshell It isn’t surprising that Bernabò Visconti di Modrone appears buoyant and energised when we meet on a screen. His company, Artshell, had once again created the online platform for the recent Miart, one of the largest Italian art fairs that take place annually in Milan and Design Week was about to kick off. Milan is the heart of the creative industry in Italy. If you have had the pleasure of strolling through the Brera district of this city, which is lined with clothing and interior shops all boasting locally made products, you would have some idea of innovation and design nous that drives this city’s economy. This might not be Silicon Valley but it is the sort of place you would expect an art tech company to be birthed. When Modrone founded Artshell in 2017 he was motivated to create the software and tools to archive and manage a collection of artworks that were beyond the reach of collectors and small art dealers. “In 2017 the problem was that the available programs were complicated. They were professional tools for archives for governments, museums and big collectors. People did not have access to any easy tool to create their inventory or to easily manage their collection.” Modrone also identified a need for galleries, which are small businesses largely, to have access to tools to archive, track and promote their inventory, whether through sharing PDFs or online catalogues or generating newsletters. Artshell was developed to meet all these various demands. “We wanted to create a professional suite of tools. Creating an inventory is our core business. You can share part of your collection, which remains on the website. You can connect with customers or collectors. So, the idea was to try to help the art market with one single instrument,” says Modrone. When the company was established in 2017, some in the industry could not have predicted how vital businesses like Artshell would be to sustaining sales and interactions. Naturally, when the Covid-19 pandemic took hold and art fairs and exhibitions and the trading and marketing of art migrated to online platforms, Artshell’s business evolved and grew. Image Courtesy: Artshell “Before the pandemic, the art market was completely different (to the one it is now) because galleries, collectors, perhaps only used 5% of the technology (that exists). Using technology wasn’t seen as being so important but after the pandemic that changed.” With physical events unable to take place, digital platforms became the focus. “Finally, the market understood that technology was not an enemy and it had the power to sell art online.” Fortunately, Artshell was in the ideal position to exploit this openness to engaging with art online, but it had to quickly adapt to offer art fairs various new tools to engage with audiences. South Africans might not be aware of their familiarity with Artshell, which generated an online interface for the Investec Cape Town Art Fair for its first online edition which took place during the pandemic. Artshell has continued with this relationship and will facilitate online engagement with virtual and in-person visitors to RMB Latitudes Art Fair. This has remained an area of development, particularly since live art fairs have resumed and the online corollary to these events has had to assert its function to dealers and visitors. “This period is really interesting because actually, no one has understood how art can be promoted or sold using a website. We are looking at the best way to adapt technology to this market. If you need to buy something really useful, there is Amazon where you can easily find everything. There are other conventions to manage the fashion market online. The art market doesn&apos;t have the right model yet. Everyone is trying to explore and find it,” says Modrone. The role technology will play not only in the archiving and promotion of art but production too is still evolving, says Modrone. The rise and then fall of the NFT market and intense interest in the metaverse, which has now been overtaken by heightened awareness of AI could be evidence of this shifting space. Image Courtesy: Artshell Concerning developments in AI, Artshell have yet to harness machine learning in its products. Modrone suggests that the difficulty in applying it in the field of art relates to the fact that art objects are all unique and would require quite a rigorous classification scheme to identify similarities beyond the medium, size, or identity, or nationality of an artist. However, he seems confident that in time it will be possible to employ AI in a way that will enhance buying art. Modrone hails from an art background, having previously managed a bronze casting studio in his native Milan. However, he considers Artshell a ‘tech company’, but admits that his first-hand knowledge of the art market has been essential to its growth and success. “We have a really strong tech team. We are, of course, a small company compared to other big companies that work in the tech space. But, we know the art market so we know all the rules. We also know that businesses and people in this field are interested in the look and feel, the aesthetic aspects of online interactions. We also have an idea of what galleries and collectors need.”</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/why-we-aren-t-dismissing-figuration-and-you-shouldn-t-either</link>
      <description>Opinion | Why we aren’t dismissing figuration (and you shouldn’t either) Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum, Destroyer II, 2020. Image courtesy of the artist&apos;s website --------- 2020 was a landmark year for contemporary African art. The pandemic expedited the digitisation of African art and saw many artists turning to social media to create awareness around their work, hoping to stay afloat under extremely challenging circumstances. We saw artists assume the role of creator, marketer and copywriter and the traditional gallery system was called into question. With people glued to the news and their phone screens with little else to do, it didn’t take long for the brutal murder of George Floyd by police in the US to capture international attention and to spark global outrage. This saw the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement and discourse around race and identity yet unmatched in scale; again, as a result of the globalisation that digital tools and platforms enable. Lerato Nkosi, Consecrated Tyrannies, 2022, R 32,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY In the art industry, there was a ‘sudden’ collective realisation that the histories and experiences of Black artists and artists of Color have long been ignored, neglected or actively erased from both public and private collections. Figurative works were highly sought after during this period of time; compounded by the discourse outlined above, we observed an exponential increase in demand for African portraiture, as collectors sought to fill what are often referred to as ‘gaps’ in their collections (Haynes, 2020). After a three year buying frenzy, we see the demand for Black portraiture declining. While some might argue that this is basic economics and that the demand for and supply of these pieces is simply stabilizing, it is hard to accept this when multiple parties in the local and international industry refer to African portraiture as ‘boring’ or ‘tired.’ So, we ask: what do these shifts in demand indicate about the global art industry and its relationship with contemporary African art? Moreover, what impact do key players in the continental art ecosystem have on this relationship? Sthenjwa Luthuli, Untold Stories, R 120,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Revisiting the role of technology, it makes sense that there was a significant boost in the demand for and acquisition of Black figurative pieces in 2020; there were not only more collectors looking to acquire the aforementioned, but more contemporary African artists’ works were accessible on digital platforms at this point in time. However, when the decline in demand for African figuration is reviewed in conjunction with the skyrocketing demand for Latin American artists at present, it highlights that the vast majority of Western collectors and institutions’ acquisitions are trend-driven. This indicates that many still perceive contemporary African art as a trend and that an undercurrent of exoticism, the pursuit of &apos;otherness&apos;, is a key factor in their buying practices. Zanele Muholi, Bona, Charlottesville, 2015. Image courtesy Berliner Festspiele Stepping outside of the realm of portraiture, we observe similar attitudes reflected in Western acquisitions of contemporary African photography. Acclaimed photographers like Ernest Cole, Zanele Muholi and Peter Magubane have never shied away from depicting the harsh social and political realities of South Africa, past and present. While these artists&apos; legacies should not be contended, their work has thrived in international markets, exposed to an audience very far removed from the reality in which it was created. To transport their audience to a certain time, place and experience is, of course, an artist’s job; however, far too often narratives on the African experience have been reclaimed, reworked and commercialized to the detriment of the work and the artist. We came across a fantastic article by Shantay Robinson wherein she poses a most poignant question: ‘Black people may be present in the western art historical canon now. But are the stories of these regular people being expressed through the work? When we look back, will we know their stories?’ Here, one ought to review the manner in which African galleries, institutions and auction houses market African artists to Western collectors. These key players often position themselves as agents of change; while it would be misguided to argue that they have not advanced the international market for contemporary African art, we question how responsibly they are representing Africa and her artists on a global stage. Are they really seeking to inspire discourse that shifts the narrative around Africa and its art, or are they actively appealing to existing Western ideologies about Africa in pursuit of profits or recognition? Sphephelo Mnguni, We&apos;re Not Poor, 2021, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY When in a certain setting, many gallerists will admit that ‘poverty porn’ sells; simultaneously, many Black artists are questioning why discussions about their respective oeuvres are largely centered around trauma (Shezi, 2021). While discussing this article with Nkhensani Mkhari (Latitudes Online), he underlined how far removed the realities of many gallerists and influential institutional figures in Africa are from the majority of artists on the ground. Oftentimes, despite presenting work that celebrates Blackness in its various manifestations, the narrative perpetuated by many galleries is centred around the artists’ personal trials or traumas. Many artists have expressed deep frustrations around the commodification of trauma and Micha Serraf addressed this issue quite eloquently when discussing this topic: ‘Of course we have experienced trauma, but it is not the sole lens through which we view life and that, in and of itself, is worth celebrating.’ Instead of pointing fingers at what some are doing wrong, we would prefer to highlight what others are doing right, and it would be remiss of us to omit Zeitz MOCAA from this discussion. Under the directorship of Koyo Kouoh, this museum is successfully communicating that there should not be one broad brushstroke applied to the African experience or art from the continent. From the well-researched and beautifully curated When We See Us to Gilt by Mary Evans, Zeitz is presenting a considered programme that showcases the complexities and nuances of Pan-African identities and experiences. As we work towards creating a sustainable art market in Africa, we think that it is imperative to reinforce the importance of a multi-faceted contribution to the international industry, one that is isolated from trends. Quite frankly, we think that it is a mistake to dismiss figuration or to refer to it as overdone; after all, how can a three year spotlight on Black portraiture address centuries of neglect and erasure? - Camilla van Hoogstraten and Zak Buthelezi References: Haynes, S., 2020. ‘The Archive Means We Are Counted in History.’ Zanele Muholi on Documenting Black, Queer Life in South Africa [online].

      <title>Tracing the threads of abstraction</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/tracing-the-threads-of-abstraction</link>
      <description>Tracing the threads of abstraction - By Mary Corrigall ------------- Moffat Takadiwa, Bhiro ne Bepa (pen and paper), 2023, pen leftovers, computer keys and toothbrushes, image courtesy the artist and Nicodim Gallery An exhibition focusing on textile works is easy to identify. The title typically involves a play on words alluding to the medium. Consider this list of titles of shows; Ravelled Threads, Queer Threads, Narrative Threads, Where the threads are worn and Pulling at Threads . Not only are the titles for these kinds of exhibitions formulaic but to some degree so too are the selection of artists, or works with curators assembling African artists who work with materials, weaving or simply use discarded, disused objects to create a sort of carpet, surface could fit the ‘textile’ category. One of the less explored aspects of the so-called textile art movement/medium in African expression is an investigation into the use of abstraction and more precisely what artistic, conceptual or ideological value textiles activate via the use of this mode as opposed to say painting. This is despite the fact that artists working with a broad definition of textiles are similarly guided by their materials, the formal features of their works, intuition and, of course, a desire to escape linear or figurative narratives. While South African-based artists such as Thania Petersen, Billie Zangewa and Athi-Patra Ruga have been celebrated for their figurative textile artworks, on the whole, it is the textile artists working in an abstract mode that dominate and have perhaps enjoyed a higher profile – think of El Anatsui, Joël Andrianomearisoa, Abdoulaye Konaté, Igshaan Adams, Moffat Takadiwa and more recently newcomers such as Bonolo Kavula and Bev Butkow. Igshaan Adams, Kicking Dust , Kunsthalle Zürich, 2022, installation view, photograph: Annik Wetter These artists aren’t simply rewiring our conception of abstraction as the preserve of painters but can access and introduce other kinds of qualities and concepts that painting denies. In their use of disused materials and off-cuts Butkow and Takadiwa can interweave layers of social subtext into a mode often thought to be apolitical. The labour required to create textile works demands that the artists have to rely on teams of ‘workers’. This draws attention to not only the relationship between work and art, and the power relationships involved in art production but, more importantly, muddies the notion of single authorship of art-making, albeit that the works produced by Adams, Takadiwa or Butkow are attributed to them as individuals. Yet the works they produce with their teams are the sum of communal engagement with materials over long periods. Significantly, abstraction via textiles upturns this vocabulary as one originating from white male artists from the West. Since the emergence of abstract painting – at least according to an outdated version of western art history where male artists are privileged – the dividing line between painted works and textile ones and the definition of art relied on whether the composition was perceived as ‘ornamental.’ Igshaan Adams, Open Production at the A4 Arts Foundation in Cape Town, 2020, Courtesy of A4 Arts Foundation “Pioneers such as Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian looked upon ornament as a sin in which abstraction should not indulge,” posited Markus Brüderlin, one of the curators of the exhibition Ornament and Abstraction: The Dialogue between Non-Western, Modern and Contemporary Art , which showed at the Fondation Beyeler, Basel Switzerland in 2001. As the title of that exhibition hints, due to a strong relationship between expression from the global South and the advent of abstract painting in the West, the painterly mode has been haunted by the &apos;decorative&apos; arts – clay, wood or ceramic, and textiles. As it emerged from a dialogue with art from expression in the global south. The dividing line between art and craft was further cemented by the American critic Clement Greenberg who “used the decorative as a critical device to distinguish &apos;high&apos; abstract painting from &apos;decoration&apos; defined as a form of surface attractiveness masquerading as art,” observes Elissa Auther in her journal article, The Decorative, Abstraction, and the Hierarchy of Art and Craft in the Art Criticism of Clement Greenberg . The erosion of these hierarchies, which African art and contemporary artists have contributed towards, has allowed for mediums associated with ‘decorative’ art to be valued. Prizing female artists have also contributed towards shifting attitudes as so much of the prejudice related to so-called decorative arts and textiles was due to it being associated with women. So perhaps it is not unexpected that largely artists working with textiles are either queer men or women. Igshaan Adams Studio Team an der Arbeit, Igshaan Adams Open Production at the A4 Arts Foundation in Cape Town, 2020, Courtesy of A4 Arts Foundation In Elizabeth Wayland Barber’s Women&apos;s Work: The First 20,000 Years: Women, Cloth, and Society in Early Times (2005) the American archaeologist was able to establish that women were mostly responsible for the weaving of textiles in primitive societies. Butkow believes that could explain why she feels that making woven art comes so instinctively to her. “It is like giving birth… your body just knows what to do and how to do it,” says the Joburg-based artist, who will stage a solo exhibition, ‘weaving off-grid - re-working m/other’, at the Origin Centre at Wits University. It will be paired with a Creative Laboratory centred on “women&apos;s work as artistic practice.” In the footsteps of Anatsui, Takadiwa doesn’t weave or produce traditional textiles – he tends to use disused mass-produced materials such as toothpaste bottles, and bottle tops from various products sold in his native Zimbabwe. However, his practice remains closely tied to the Korekore weaving traditions in his country that were not only traditionally in the hands of women but were in everyday use by women. Not that Takadiwa has personal experience with this. Interestingly, despite growing up in a rural area, he was not raised to follow traditions. He says he grew up with a &quot;conflict with culture&quot; due to his father eschewing traditions – he opted out of being a chief and the coronation that would seal this status. Moffat Takadiwa: Vestiges of Colonialism, Installation View, National Gallery of Zimbabwe, Harare, 2023. image courtesy the artist and Nicodim Gallery “My father didn’t want us to associate with anything like witchcraft,” says Takadiwa, who recently staged his first and possibly largest museum exhibition, Vestiges of Colonialism , at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare. As the title of that exhibition suggests, the artist is interested in drawing attention to the way in which the legacy of colonialism lingers and has shaped Zimbabwe’s current political situation, which he does through the objects that relate to that era. Despite the political intent driving this exhibition, and the many works and installations in it, he opts for an abstract language. This is not due to any fear that there might be blowback – the Zimbabwean government doesn’t have a good record when it comes to protecting freedom of expression (political journalists are regularly jailed). “The government isn’t interested in what visual artists have to say,” he says. Rather, he suggests that abstract expression can have more impact, albeit in a quieter way. “It allows you to be more subtle. We need to use a clever language and clever ways to communicate. This can be even more powerful,” he says. As such Takadiwa relies on his choice of materials to introduce the socio-political element, though from afar the large-scale hanging works he creates deny the specificity of his materials and to some degree, some of the subtleties might be lost on outsiders. For example, he opts to work with mass-produced items that carry class distinctions in Zimbabwe – like the lids of cooking oil bottles or toothpaste tubes. Growing up in a rural setting, he didn’t have access to these items and “sees them as objects of leisure and class.” It is also perhaps no coincidence that his father worked at a supermarket and he spent his youth gazing at the items on the shelves. Butkow’s relationship to her materials is somewhat different – she derives much of her materials from a friend with a clothing business and has less of a personal connection to them. However, in her practice she tries to connect to them physically, letting their ‘materiality’ guide the process. Of generations past, and future - detail, Made with Thandiswa Maxinyane, 2023, Thread, dressmaking scraps, copper rod, time and effort, 380 x 170 cm, Image courtesy Bev Butkow, Guns &amp; Rain, Anthea Pokroy “I don&apos;t have an idea upfront. I&apos;m trying hard to develop a collaborative relationship with my materials,” she says. Butkow is guided by a quote (from 1944) by Anni Albers, the Bauhaus era abstract textile artist, that reads: “We learn to listen to voices: to the yes or no of our material, our tools, our time. We come to know that only when we feel guided by them our work takes on form and meaning, that we are misled when we follow only our will.” Butkow was drawn to an abstract language as she was seeking out “existing in the world in a different way”, which for her not only meant walking away from a corporate job and becoming an artist but embracing a language that offered “multiple perspectives, and multiple ways to see things.” Bev Butkow, dappled perspectives, made with Thandiswa Maxinyane, 2022, Wool, string, twine, copper rod, time and labour 210 x 210 cm, image courtesy Bev Butkow, Guns &amp; Rain, Anthea Pokroy Butkow’s compositions are less compact than Takadiwa’s, yet what is striking about both of their works are the gaps or holes, and openings in their compositions. “It&apos;s referencing the information that lies in the space in between what we see,” suggests Butkow. She says this drive possibly relates to her personal family history. Her grandparents are Jews from Eastern Europe and while they survived the Holocaust, there is “a lack of knowledge about our family going back.” A cartographic aesthetic also defines the work of several abstract textile artists. Adams has literally dug into this quality. In his show Kicking Dust, which opened at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2021, some of his compositions were inspired by Google Earth satellite images mapping the once-racially segregated borders between Bonteheuwel, where he grew up, and Langa, the neighbouring township. Bev Butkow, Lines of Flight, Made with Heid Stroh, 2022, String, plastic cord, wooden slats, embodied traces of time/ labour/exertion/conversation/instruction, Approx size 200 x 270 cm, Image courtesy Bev Butkow, Guns &amp; Rain, Anthea Pokroy The boundaries and territories that many of these artists depict, however, are not easily contained – their compositions trail off into hanging pieces, lines that trail on the ground or are sometimes large and unwieldy or appear fragile and temporary. These are all characteristics that textile constructions allow for in ways that traditional art mediums such as painting simply can’t. From this point of view, the painted medium appears to limit the possibilities of abstraction, which ultimately is rooted in ambiguity and being open-ended. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based commentator, advisor and independent researcher.</description>

The thirty-three-year-old artist was born in Cairo, and lives and practices there and indeed the sense of chaos that defines the compositions of her abstract paintings could represent the erosion of democratic values, political order and worsening social conditions. However, two qualities of her art stand in the way of geographically defining it. Not only did her time living in London shift her language and set her on the path she is on now, but her interpretation of the body in her art resonates with how many high-profile female artists – from Christina Quarles to Wangetchi Mutu, to Louise Bonnet – are representing the female form. Yet it would also be an oversimplification of Baraka’s art to zone in on qualities that it might share with other female artists. She does not directly depict the female form, albeit her treatment of the body in her art – as distorted and disembodied – denies objectification, and the male gaze, and aligns with how female artists are representing it. Chiming in with current attitudes where gender fluidity is being advanced, the human body in her art is genderless. She was recently named the winner of the ANNA Award, which is focused on celebrating female-identifying artists. She is, of course, delighted to have won this award, which has brought her to the attention of South African collectors and she counts herself as fortunate to have entered the art landscape at a time when there is heightened interest in supporting female artists. “History wasn&apos;t kind to females in the past. A lot of very good and interesting female artists never had the chance to exhibit or develop their work because they weren&apos;t even a part of the art scene. They struggled a lot. The fact that everything is online means you can&apos;t really hide, you can&apos;t be unfair because the world will know. This is a great power that we have now,” says Baraka via Google Meet from Cairo. Nada Baraka, Ghost in the attic, 2021, acrylic and oil on canvas, SOLD The celebration of female artists hasn’t necessarily changed realities on the ground, she adds. “In the day-to-day life, of course, there is a lot of inequality and harassment. It&apos;s a man&apos;s world.” She completed her undergraduate degree in fine art in Cairo, but, significantly, she was based in London for the two years it took her to do a master&apos;s at Central Saint Martins. Cairo may be steeped in ancient visual culture, but in London Baraka had time to soak up the abundance of contemporary art that flows through this vital Western art capital. “There are hundreds of galleries, and exhibitions happening everywhere (in London). It was mind-blowing, the art was super diverse. Because a lot of the museums had retrospectives, I got to see an artist’s full body of work and development,” recalls Baraka. This was in stark contrast to the contemporary art scene in Cairo, which deteriorated since the revolution, says Baraka. “We have only two or three institutions, and there is one major commercial gallery where most of the artists exhibit. The scene in Egypt is very limited.” The British artist Francis Bacon had an impact on Baraka – she frequently saw his paintings while living in London. You can trace this influence in her painting – her treatment of the body – as a contorted and atomised form. However, as is often the case with artists her art is the result of a confluence of visual inspirations that are melded, formed and manifest innately. Nada Baraka in studio, courtesy of the artist “I start working without having a plan. I don&apos;t do (a preliminary) sketch and I don&apos;t know what the outcome of the artwork is going to be,” she observes. This process no doubt guarantees the sense of disordered chaos that defines her paintings. This characteristic could be a reflection of life in Egypt. “It&apos;s very chaotic here. In Egypt, there are no rules. Life is not easy in Egypt but at the same time, you get to experience so much because you can do anything here,” she observes. Baraka, however, ascribes this sense of chaos in her art to her interest in depicting violence. Unexpectedly, the sense of disruption and turmoil she evokes is softened by her chosen palette, of pastel shades. Pinks, yellows, and warm welcoming tones infuse her paintings. Baraka believes that this contrast or unexpected juxtaposition is drawn from her love of animated films and TV shows, which she has long admired. Tom and Jerry captured her imagination, particularly in how violence is represented via cute animal characters in appealing feminine colours, which somehow obscures the true nature of the gruesome acts they commit. Fortunately, her experience of direct violence appears to be limited to watching cartoons. However, there are significant events in her life that have forced her to consider the fragility of the human body. Nada Baraka, Fission series 1, 2022, €270 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Her cousin’s experience with muscular dystrophy was the inspiration for one of her art projects. “It&apos;s a very difficult disease to live with. All of your muscles keep eating your body until you can’t walk, move, eat or swallow,” says Baraka. These experiences might well account for the distorted body parts or organic forms that recur throughout her work, hinting at a body turning on itself. Indeed, her paintings could depict a diseased body from the inside, as Baraka also shares that she is interested in worlds within worlds. There is a surreal vibe to her paintings, though recognisable objects such as light bulbs or ladders anchor images replete with floating organic forms, which evoke, plants, underwater creatures or body parts. Architectural lines – hinting at interior spaces or buildings – tend to frame these abstract and expressive forms, loosely suggesting domestic narratives, or perhaps chaos versus structure binaries or taken further male versus female – read in the juxtaposition between the angular and organic forms. The abstract turn in her art manifested after her time in London, but she is unable to pinpoint the precise influences that led her to shift in this direction. What is certain is that when she returned to Cairo in 2015 she was on her way to developing her art, a signature even, that was identifiable but also resonated with collectors from the Middle East who gravitated to the most prominent gallery in that city – Gypsum. It has carved out an international reputation through its participation in high-profile art fairs such as Art Basel and Frieze London. Baraka has shown two solo exhibitions at this gallery – Cosmic Truths and Tales to be Told in 2019 and Land of Sequels in 2021. Baraka’s next art exhibition sees her adopting an entirely different approach to her gallery shows and with paintings that are self-consciously grounded in a location, and space. She is along with other artists making artworks in response to her late grandfather’s archive. The project is collaborative, installation and site-specific based and motivated not only by Baraka’s personal history but a need to create alternative spaces for artists in a city with few opportunities for artists. Nada Barka, Withstanding the vagaries , 2019 The exhibition is set in her grandfather’s apartment in Cairo, which has been preserved since his death. It houses his extensive collection of photographs, maps and plans (he worked in the Ministry of Irrigation) and other ephemera. He appears to have been meticulously archiving his life, and interests. “My grandfather was a very good archivist. I think we might have ruined his archive because we didn&apos;t understand it in the beginning. Everything from like the smallest silliest things, to the important documents (were stored). He was very articulate. He did everything, himself. He took and developed his own photographs.” No matter how precise and ordered Baraka’s grandfather&apos;s archives might be, beneath his structured approach to mapping his life there must have been messy details, unfinished narratives and contradictions. With her characteristic approach to her expression, no doubt Baraka will draw these qualities to the surface.

      <description>Cut &amp; Paste art exposes the gaps in historical and digital archives - By Mary Corrigall --------- Lakin Ogunbanwo, Chillin’ in my Cerebellum, 2023, courtesy WHATIFTHEWORLD gallery The contemporary condition is such that there are no longer any art movements – even if there are discernible aesthetic or conceptual qualities characterising the art finding favour. This is largely due to transitions moving in short cycles and existing in parallel to other discernible trends, and certainly they are not bound by elaborate manifestos as per Europe&apos;s avant-garde culture. This leaves art historians or commentators insufficient time to name or claim them. Yet currently, it is possible to draw a fairly straight line between several artists&apos; practices which evidence a playful if not surrealist manipulation of archival imagery or photographs. The artists that come to mind are Teresa Kutala Firmino, Phumulani Ntuli, Thato Toeba, Neo Matlogo, Lunga Ntila and newcomer Kaelo Molefe. Even established documentary-style photographers such as the Nigerian Lakin Ogunbanwo have taken to manipulating photos, arriving at sometimes abstract compositions. This is not a new way of working, collaging with found imagery dates back to European Dadaists such as Hannah Höch. In the African art context, Sam Nthlengethwa (who was inspired by the African American artist, Romare Bearden) has been incorporating found images in his paintings since at least the 80s and Wangechi Mutu, the Kenyan-born artist has in the last decade enjoyed much success in the US exploiting the collaging mode to evoke hybrid beings with a foot in the past, future or the natural world. Yet, here we find a group of young, emerging and established African artists employing collage in paintings or paperworks centred on collaged photographs, mostly to arrive at strange-looking subjects with fragmented bodies or faces. What might be compelling another generation to regurgitate, reinvent, consume and alter existing images? It could be a way to renew the possibilities in painting and photography. Given some of the above-mentioned artists combine and blur the lines between these mediums, they might be interested in the tension between truth and fiction. Documentary photography has been impacted by technology. Everyone has a camera on their phones. Lakin Ogunbanwo, Its only gluttony if you feel guilty “I do think our relationship to photographic images has changed for sure,” says Ogunbanwo. “When I was younger my family and I would dress up to go to the studio to get a family portrait. Now people are constantly capturing beautiful moments on their phones every day,” he adds. This culture has not only forced photographers to carefully consider what images would have social or artistic resonance but, says Ogunbanwo, has given rise to an excess of images – veritable archives of imagery to be consumed – in creative ways. Ogunbanwo’s new collage works, which debuted at the FNB Art Joburg&apos;s WHATIFTHEWORLD&apos;s booth, see him reworking, and recontextualising his own archive of images, though he says in the future he may consider working with found images or those from specific archives. It was following an encounter with El Anatsui years back that left him with a nagging desire to identify ‘materials’ that were like second nature to him. “I was on a portrait assignment for the New Yorker to shoot elements in his (Anatsui’s) studio in Nigeria. I was asking him about his process. I asked him specifically how he knew he had hit the jackpot with his sculptures. He said he chose to work with materials familiar to him, which were old bottle covers. He also said it wasn&apos;t about knowing, it was about playing,” recalls Ogunbanwo. It has taken some time for Ogunbanwo to realise that the most familiar materials to him were his own images. In creating collages with his own archive, he has been able to reconsider and appreciate different characteristics of work, looking beyond the subject matter. Colour and textures have always been important to him - given his link to the fashion world - but in this context, these qualities took on a different function. He could juxtapose textures from different images in places in time. This freed him up from his documentary practice but also allowed him to make abstract works. “With photography what is special about the medium also limits it. It captures the truth that the photographer has made up but also truths that just exist,” says Ogunbanwo. In some of his collages, a human body is discernable, but through this medium, it is rendered expressively. In other works, the ‘truth’ – its connection to the figurative world – is denied through a swirl of images caught up in a whirl of sorts, implying that the seen world is beyond grasp. Teresa Kutala Firmino Njuju Tree, 2022, courtesy Everard Read This notion resonates with a comment Ntuli made when he was discussing his practice ahead of it being featured on the South African Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2022. “I am interested in the collision between reality and fantasy because something happens when they meet. I think memory becomes so unreliable because it is fragmented, it’s like a piece of a puzzle or as a frame of a photograph,” said Ntuli. This mode/medium of expression presents a shift in the position of the photographer artist, or artist working with photography – they are not beholden to framing a moment in time, but reframing it. As such collaging with images is concerned with the role of photography in reconciling with history and as Ntuli suggests the shortcomings of doing so. Firmino’s family history is often raised in introductions to her work. Born from parents who both escaped conflicts in their native countries (the Congo and Angola) and having grown up in a town in South Africa where some of the local population are former soldiers of the 32 Battalion (an army of black South Africans who fought for the Apartheid state) it is assumed that any understanding of her art relies on knowing that she is haunted by social and political tensions. This may have set her on the path to combining photomontage with painting. However, in more recent works, her mode of incorporating collaged heads and other elements of the mostly female subjects that feature in her art seems tied to how the female body is presented, celebrated and objectified. There is a historical thread to this theme but in the work Lust, Consumption, Needs (2022) for example, where two cameras are positioned on either side of a female subject, it is easy to imagine Firmino is interested in how the proliferation of cameras and constant documentation of the self has given rise to many public permutations, but also has collapsed fixed notions of the ideal body. Firmino’s subjects are voluptuous and proud, but ever conscious of the camera, the gaze of many. The proliferation of social media has democratised the ‘gaze’ but it has also heightened the necessity to craft a variety of public personas that may not coincide with a private shifting self, causing a pervasive sense of dissonance. The collage mode suits articulating the fragmentation and perhaps fractures that bear down on identities performing for different publics. It provides a language to show the constructed nature of the public self and the variety of public selves that are literally pasted onto an ever-evolving body – and set of contexts. Collage affords the artist, maker, agency over history and the biases that have shaped certain archives, forever fixing some subjects in a ‘gaze’ that sought to subjugate them. This relates to Kaelo Molefe’s practice. In line with the works, he is currently showing at his exhibition at Kalashnikovv gallery titled Other Schematics he reworks, and scrutinises, a largely ‘scientific’ archive (though images are derived from multiple sources) from the 19th Century used to justify racism and imperialism. Having studied medicine Molefe is naturally interested in the role science has played in defining the body under the titular schematics. This background has also shaped Molefe’s approach to dissecting archives, in the way that he isolates small parts of existing material, as if studying it under a microscope, before reconstituting a new image. The new image is never whole - the parts float at a distance from each other. In this way, the body is truly fragmented, and he uses these ‘gaps’ to insert lines or other images unrelated to the human body to draw attention to the other parts that constitute the self. In The Running Man (2021), a cut-out of a cityscape stands in for a chest and could refer to not only a contemporary condition but the ties that bind the titular man to a place that is embedded in his body. In an interview with the now-defunct New Frame , Molefe suggested that collage is an inherently “political medium” as it allows him, or other artists for that matter, to not only disrupt historical narratives but “reconfigure their meaning”. Collage also affords artists the ability to communicate the lingering impact of historical narratives. While there is a sense of disjuncture in the art of Ntuli, it is much less pronounced. He uses collage in conjunction with painting and printing to draw attention to how historical social, political or psychic patterns pervade the present. In this way, the bodies he presents consist of a collaged pattern. Ntuli’s works are pleasing to the eye due to his approach, but also his pastel palette is soothing. This suggests a time gap between the present, where his subjects exist and, between the black-and-white images/prints evoking the past that dominate his subjects&apos; frames. Phumulani Ntuli, Zama Zama, R146,930.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE In the information age, Ntuli’s practice also engages with the proliferation of data. This came more sharply into view in his recent solo exhibition of works for David Krut under the title Kunanela iphuzu emafini / Echoes of the Point Cloud. In an interview relating to that body of work, he observed that he viewed collage as a response to how reality is being reframed not simply via images but how data is being organised. From this perspective, collaging emerges as an art form that mirrors the process of reconstituting existing information. However, as these artists make the cuts and slices and the act of rearranging the truth visible, they draw attention to gaps in our digital realities.

      <description>Latitudes sits down with artist Phumulani Ntuli ----------- Phumulani Ntuli in studio working on a large scale collage on canvas, courtesy David Krut Projects Latitudes Online (LO): What piqued your interest in art and how did you realise your practice from there? Phumulani Ntuli (PN): My journey into the world of art commenced in my early years when I discovered my ability to draw. Utilising images as references became a common practice for my pencil sketches. This revelation occurred during my time in sub-B (grade 2) when my biology teacher assigned us the task of illustrating human anatomy, focusing on hands, faces, torsos, and limbs. The assignment, which we carried out over the weekend, required meticulous attention to detail as I studied my references intently. Upon submission, I didn&apos;t anticipate much significance, but to my surprise, my teacher was captivated by my artistic skill. She summoned another teacher to inspect my drawing, leaving me momentarily anxious, thinking I might be in trouble. However, it turned out that I was being recognized for my talent. This experience boosted my confidence, prompting me to share my sketches with others, particularly at family gatherings. I even ventured into creating portraits of family members. This artistic journey gained momentum, thanks to the encouragement of my late friend, Themba Ziphilele Moyake. Although he explored drawing and painting, he ultimately pursued African literature at Wits, leaving me to delve deeper into the realm of art. Attending seminars at Wits during my free time exposed me to academic papers and presentations, all while I maintained a full-time position in retail. This period of self-education enlightened me about university-level academic programs, leading me to apply to the University of Johannesburg after completing my undergrad. Embarking on various projects, my first residency at Bag Factory marked a significant step in my artistic pursuits. Subsequently, I pursued an MFA in Switzerland, kept afloat by a partial scholarship I was fortunate to receive. Phumulani Ntuli, Prompt search from a generative console, R 26,086.96 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: As I understand it, your practice explores notions of black futurity and the archive - and to quote Lukanyo Mbanga “a futurist is a historian by default”. What is the significance of this intersection between past and future and how is it represented in your work? PN: South African artmaking grapples with the shadows cast by its political history, an imprint evident in artworks mirroring the prevailing societal norms—a long-standing, one-size-fits-all approach. I contend that history, tainted as it may be, permeates the archive, and, as an artist, my perpetual endeavour is to demystify the structure within this archival framework. My exploration often navigates the realms of film and documentary practices, revealing the potential for fictionalisation within digital art forms like film and photography. On one hand, there is a probing of the media itself, utilising it as a departure point to conjure the absent elements and scenes. On the other hand, there exists a reconsideration of the media as an empowering instrument. In my artistic process, I sketch landscapes, reference various sources, and capture photographs, and appropriate images from open archives. This amalgamation of processes occasionally disrupts the pathways to visualisation, mirroring the interference of social media in our interpersonal connections and presence. Amidst these futuristic flights through such interferences, the aim is to render visible the obscured references in this operation and explore novel avenues for image generation that empower, rather than regress. The futurist strives to integrate and reconcile the media, drawing upon an extensive array of infrastructures. Viewing these modes of practice as open source, akin to open archive images, the futurist treats them as collective geographies, even if they risk decommissioning. The futurist appropriates and deaccessions these archives, incorporating them into their work. Indeed, I agree with the fact that the futurist is a historian who engages in speculation, drawing, and animating the past events in the future tense. Phumulani Ntuli, Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), on show until 26 January 2024, book to visit now LO: As a multidisciplinary artist, how has your practice evolved over the last few years? What intrigues you and gives you creative direction? PN: I am passionate about the emergence of innovative technologies in development, open-source platforms, the evolution of user interfaces, and immersive experiences. The potential of new media and its intersection with traditional art-making practices captivates me. This convergence is evident in various forms, such as software, Image Generation AI, and tools designed to simplify image production. Despite this, there exists a hesitation in recognising new media art-making as a process-based activity, with these technologies often seen as post-production tools. Take, for instance, digital images and their analogues. While they are typically encapsulated when viewed online, the metadata, code biases, and underlying architecture shaping these digital images remain unnoticed. It&apos;s crucial to acknowledge how these elements influence content manipulation and form. Phumulani Ntuli, Point Cloud, R 135,582.61 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY These reflections drive my creative impulse. I am constantly exploring alternative ways to navigate the online space, steering away from conventional social media platforms. This exploration spans open-source platforms, software, and unconventional practices for visualising and manipulating images. Moreover, I actively engage in collaborative efforts with developers within my collective practice, leveraging insights gained as research processes or as integral components of new artistic work. LO: You are an artist who strives for independence in your practice. What about this is so important to you? PN: During my formative years as a young artist, the prevailing trend in Johannesburg was for artists to consign with galleries, curators, or project spaces. This meant actively seeking opportunities that aligned with their artistic vision or responding to invitations that came their way. This approach was widespread among many emerging artists in Johannesburg, and I believe it continues to be the norm. Independent practices, often manifesting in collective studios or project spaces—examples being the late Assemblage Studios and the current Bag Factory Artists Studio—constitute a significant and enduring model within the professional art-making landscape. Within this artistic milieu, discussions revolve around project-based practices, collaborations, residencies, and pop-up exhibitions, among other avenues. For many emerging artists, adopting this mode of operation has become almost intuitive, providing a means to showcase their work and gain visibility within the art world. Independent practices typically involve navigating from one project to the next, sometimes engaging in collaborative efforts while also carving out time for individual pursuits. This operational template became a standard for me early on, and I now find myself more at ease and confident in working this way. Opening night at Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), featured monotypes by Phumulani Ntuli on show until 26 January 2024, book to visit now It&apos;s worth noting that embracing independent practices doesn&apos;t necessarily preclude being associated with established institutions. Many artists aspire to have a presence in such spaces. For me, the concept of independent practice evolved organically, influenced by the direction my career was taking. Faced with a particular set of circumstances, I had to make choices—whether to prioritise my own artistic endeavours, collaborate with fellow practitioners, or actively seek opportunities aligned with my ethical values in the art business. LO: What would you advise other artists who wish to remain independent? What have been some of your biggest learnings and challenges along the way? PN: Firstly, I believe most artists aspire to establish stability in their careers. While the idea of being part of a stable environment is often inherent in an artist&apos;s mindset, navigating the independent route requires actively seeking and seizing opportunities that align with one&apos;s vision. Despite the challenges of maintaining independence, such as juggling multiple roles, it is important to handle these tasks efficiently to strike a balance between creative expression and business responsibilities. Maintaining a clear intention is equally vital. Drawing from my personal experience, I registered a business and took deliberate steps to acquire the necessary skills for its operation. Leveraging my background in administration, I honed my business management skills. This strategic approach ensures that both the creative drive and the business aspects complement each other harmoniously. Secondly, building a successful art career is a long-term endeavour. The concept of development remains pertinent throughout an artist&apos;s journey, even for established individuals who continually evolve their work. Engaging in meaningful collaborations within and beyond the art world is essential. This extends to professional partnerships with individuals such as lawyers, accountants, and web developers, broadening the artist&apos;s network and enhancing their overall professional framework. LO: What tools and practices are essential to your success as an independent artist? PN: Over the years, I&apos;ve come to realise that establishing an independent artistic practice demands a diverse skill set encompassing both creative and administrative abilities. Not every artist possesses the inclination for paperwork, and the tendency to avoid it can have significant drawbacks. Therefore, I believe it&apos;s crucial for artists to acknowledge the importance of honing skills beyond their creative talents. In my perspective, successful independent practice hinges on collaboration and the ability to define collaboration terms, recognising that these terms vary with each opportunity. Another essential component is the development of an integrated business model and plan, a task that undoubtedly requires a certain proficiency in writing. This proficiency becomes instrumental in crafting and presenting proposals effectively. While pursuing education in an academic institution can offer numerous benefits, it is by no means the sole path to cultivating a sustainable artistic practice. However, engaging in academic pursuits can elevate one&apos;s thinking about their craft, providing a structured environment for personal and artistic growth. I highly recommend considering this avenue, as it can serve as a valuable time to seek mentorship, explore strategies for positioning oneself in the art world, and broaden one&apos;s perspective on artistic endeavours. Phumulani Ntuli at Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), on show until 26 January 2024, book to visit now LO: In what way does a relationship with an organisation such as Latitudes help to bolster your independence? PN: I had the privilege of collaborating with Ruzy Rusike, who curated my exhibition at the Bag Factory in 2021. She introduced me to Roberta Coci as part of the marketing strategy for my exhibition. This collaboration took place as we were emerging from the lockdown, bringing with it both new insights and lingering anxieties, making it an undoubtedly challenging period. During this time, I actively engaged with the Latitudes platform, seizing all the possibilities it offered with Ruzy&apos;s valuable assistance. Latitudes, functioning as an intermediary, creates a bridge between artists and collectors, as well as institutions. This connection can be particularly challenging to establish independently. The organisation serves as a crucial third party, facilitating access to a broader audience. Maintaining a strong relationship with Latitudes has the potential to yield positive outcomes in one&apos;s artistic career. The platform places artworks within reach of collectors and institutions, opening doors that might otherwise be difficult to access independently. A well-nurtured partnership with Latitudes can significantly impact an artist&apos;s trajectory in the art world. Phumulani Ntuli, Messages from a beacon, R 26,086.96 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: As an artist who re-imagines new narratives and envisions future possibilities for what it means to be African, how do you envision the future of independent artistic practice and the arts ecosystem? PN: There is no doubt that independent artistic practice will persist within the art ecosystem, as evidenced by organisations like Bag Factory Artist’s Studio, which actively nurtures both established and emerging artists, and publishers like LL Editions that engage in ongoing collaborations with artists. It is crucial to recognize that the art ecosystem is expansive, extending beyond the confines of galleries, museums, project spaces, or institutions. All these spheres within the art ecosystem, strive to attain visibility by employing art as a catalyst for conversations, reflection, and the exploration of social relationships, as well as speculative ideas surrounding the human condition. The future of art creation is thrilling, with art undergoing transformational influences from social media platforms, new technologies, image generation models, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. One can choose to perceive these developments as opportunities or turn a blind eye, but in either case, individuals are prompted to reevaluate their positions within these new realms of fiction. Importantly, these innovative practices need not compromise social justice. The intersection of art with social media and technology can coexist harmoniously with a commitment to freedom.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/latitudes-chats-with-artist-sera-holland</link>
      <description>Latitudes chats with artist Sera Holland We&apos;ve taken a moment to interview Sera Holland, diving deep into her practice as an independent artist. ---------- Sera Holland, courtesy of the artist Sera Holland is a designer, illustrator and artist living and working under the slopes of Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa. While Sera was for many years better known for her textiles and homeware products, her newfound exploration of painting has grown into a full-time obsession. Sera has started to gain recognition for her love of thick impasto oil paint, where she strives to merge the abstract with the real. Up close, her artworks appear to be in total chaos, but as you zoom out, order is restored and the image is revealed. While Sera is predominantly inspired by the beautiful natural landscape in which she lives, she also enjoys exploring themes of colour and texture, often with an element of playfulness. Latitudes Online (LO): What piqued your interest in art and how did you realise your practice from there? Sera Holland (SH): I have always loved painting and drawing, and being creative and making things. When I finished school, I didn’t think I could earn a living as an artist, so I went into graphic design, which then led me into textile design. In 2018 I decided to swap making products for making paintings, and so I closed my homeware business so I could pick up a brush and spend some time painting again. I joined a weekly oil painting class and never left. In 2020, when Covid hit, there were a couple of artists who were making paintings in return for charitable donations. I really wanted to help, and so I threw caution to the wind and put myself out there. I ended up making over 40 little landscape paintings for charity before I felt confident enough to charge people for my artworks. Sera Holland, In-between, R 16,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: How do you like to describe your practice? What are important thematic considerations for your practice? SH: My practice is multi-disciplinary, but it is mostly centred around painting, which is what I enjoy doing most currently. I am also a designer and a ceramicist, so I work across all kinds of different projects at different times, which I love because it keeps things interesting. Painting is my passion, and I am having a bit of a love affair with oil paint currently. Oil paint has this magical way about it, and I often feel like I might begin a painting inspired by the beauty of nature, but I’ll end up being inspired by the beauty of the paint. There are very strong themes of colour, texture and play in my work. I love to work on big thick alla prima impasto paintings which are predominantly inspired by nature. I have my monochromatic #mypinkseries paintings where I experiment with texture and mark making, and attempt to use light and shadow as additional colours. And then I also have my little palette scallops, that are made using any leftover paint, which are basically little experiments in colour. But as much as they come across as fun and decorative, I often use them to make personal statements about the world we live in. LO : Nature is a key informant of your multidisciplinary practice; how does it present as a continuous form of inspiration and offer you creative direction across your painting, ceramic and design practices? SH: Nature is just so incredibly beautiful. Whether it is an intricate flower detail, or the way the sun shines through the trees, or the different colour combinations of the changing seasons, the inspiration is endless. My style of work is very different across the 3 practices, and even though nature is a common theme, I would choose to interpret it differently for each. Different materials often require different styles, and I like to consider both when working. LO: You are an artist who strives for independence. What about this so important to you? SH: I think it’s important to be independent and somewhat in control of your practice and your work as an artist. I don’t mean being independent as in doing everything on your own, but rather being the master of your own destiny and being able to make decisions and find partners that really align with your work and vision rather than being beholden to others who might have different intentions in mind. Sera Holland, Sunny Side, R 16,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: What would you advise other artists who wish to remain independent? What have been some of your biggest learnings and challenges along the way. SH: I think there is a big preconception that to be a successful artist you need to be with a gallery. But in today’s modern and technological world, you can do whatever you want yourself. There are artists making a living out of their home studios alone, and there are artists making a living showing in international galleries. The best thing you can do is to find the right fit for you, and for your work. No matter what other people are doing. For me, it’s all about finding balance. Balance between work I need to do and work I want to do, work that gets me paid, and work I do for fun. There was a time when I took on so many commissions because I didn’t know how (or want) to say no. But then I ended up having no time for my own work and I found it quite frustrating, despite being in a better financial situation. Now I have a waiting list for commissions so I can take them on as and when I need, while still making sure I have time to work on my own projects. LO: What tools and practices are essential to your success as an independent artist? SH: I think it’s important that I get my work out there in the right way, and that I can team up with the right people when I need. Social media is an integral tool in marketing and selling my work, so I do need to make sure that I take professional photos of my work. This is also a great opportunity to share any inspiration or background information which helps create a bigger picture of you me as an artist which I hope helps to sell my work. I also have a website with my portfolio of work, as well as a list of available work with pricing. Anything that helps make buying my work easier. Teaming up with the right people is also so important, e.g: a gallery, curator, art agent, shipping agent etc. I have had my ups and downs with a few, but finding someone I can trust makes my life a lot easier knowing I can rely on them when I need. It’s also important to have at least one person who you can chat to about your work. This is ideally someone within the art world who can offer a critical eye or help you resolve potential issues. Someone who is on your side, but isn’t afraid to provide constructive criticism. Sera Holland, Up in the Pink Fluffy Clouds (mypinkseries), R 1,500.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: In what way does a relationship with an organisation such as Latitudes help to bolster your independence? SH: Latitudes is wonderful. They offer all the benefits of working with a gallery but without some of the drawbacks. They have a large audience, being online, and a great reputation for sourcing the best in African art. They give me the opportunity to show my work to people who otherwise might not see it, and they give the buyer the reassurance that the artwork will be of highest quality and delivered in perfect condition. They are also organised and professional, and an absolute pleasure to work with. LO: As an artist who has touchpoints in all aspects of creative practice, how do you envision the future of independent artistic practice and yourself within the arts ecosystem? SH: I think one of the most exciting and scary aspects of being an artist is having no idea as to what will happen in the future. My main focus (and often mantra) is to just do the work, and the rest will follow and hopefully work out as it should. Whatever that may be, I just hope that I am happy, and that I can afford to keep making the work that I love.</description>

      <title>Between the Painting and I</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/between-the-painting-and-i</link>
      <description>Between the Painting and I By Denzo Nyathi Kirsten Sims, Read My Mind, 2024, R90,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY --------------- Brushstroke by brushstroke, through generations of reiterations and movements, ‘the painting’ has become so ubiquitous as to almost become a synonym for ‘art’ by and large. No short of thanks to the canon, most of the masterpieces of yester-art that readily come to mind are oil paintings by the likes of Van Gogh and Da Vinci. Being cautious to not equate traditional Western art practices with art itself, it’s a worthwhile reminder to consider how even tens of thousands of years ago, paintings were being painted on the rocky walls of caves in ancient societies of the Global South. In some way, the presence of a painting on every wall — from the pristine white finish of a gallery to the prehistoric archive of a cave — can be somewhat overwhelming. How has the language of paint transcended race, time, geography and cultural context? In that same breath, there is something beautifully profound about painting. Indeed, how has the language of paint transcended race, time, geography and cultural context, if not proof of it as one of those universal languages that enwraps the human experience, like dance, mathematics, and laughter amongst loved ones. I recently had the pleasure of attending Penny Siopis’ live painting demonstration, as a part of The Centre for the Less Good Idea’s Showing the Making series. With a large-scale blank canvas, ink, a bucket of water and an abundance of cold glue, the master painter took the audience through her complex thought processes around creating. Albeit impossible to condense and do justice to the thought process of an artist who has been working on her craft for 40+ years, there was one take away which has beautifully haunted me. “[One] of these fundamental questions in any image making is when we decide what is the figure and what is the ground, and why in fact do we think the figure is more important?” She mused, beginning to share aloud her thoughts on relationality and materiality. “There’s no such thing as a background. Everything is there. Figure, ground, figure, ground, figure, ground.” Penny Siopis at The Centre for The Less Good Idea In these early stages of delivering one of her iconic abstract paintings, she was unearthing truths about painting by pointing to the nature of painting itself. In highlighting the (mostly) two-dimensional plane upon which the work lives, Siopis speaks to an interesting way in which images spatially relate to one another in the painting itself. They are not bound to the same laws of three-dimensional living that their captive human viewers audiences are. Forms are intrinsically bound to one another, in spite of divisive lines and colours that might optically demarcate them. Their plane is different; it is a plane where depth is illuded into being, and not born into. Herein lies (an element of) the allure of painting. In a painter’s sacred rituals of transfiguration, they become a bridge between our world and its laws, and the world of a painting. In the case of figurative paintings, we recognise the work as a representation of a person, or a thing, and not that person or thing itself. The representation does not — cannot — bear the same gravitas and weight of that which it represents. Yet, in its immortalisation, it holds a different relationship to time, that asks us to think and feel differently. Perhaps the painting is not the “real” thing, but it immortalises a very real moment in time, in which the painter and their subject extensively engaged. The finest of paintings are able to in some way communicate the tensions between the perceiver (painter) and the perceived (subject). On the same evening of the live painting demonstration, Siopis spoke more about returning to paintings days later, changing their orientation, and re-negotiating with the then-dried works as to what more might be needed. This recalls that visceral, deep feeling in the gut, as one looks down some great opening of the earth, and can almost feel it looking back up at you. In the case of some of the finest abstract paintings, the works are a call-to-search to not just their painters, but their audiences to come. It is often a search that requires a head tilt, a step back, a step forward and a polite ask to the person beside you: “what do you think it means?” Chuma Adam, Untitled III, 2024, R8,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Layer after layer of paint application (sometimes to the point of edging figuration into abstraction) dry to solidify a tension that cannot be undone. Indeed, a tension that has never been undone. These renderings of process, figures and emotions have pulled at the heart strings of global audiences for millenia. And in encountering just the right painting, one can understand why. Although a universal language, when one comes across the right painting, it raises so many personal questions of relationality. How is it that this painter has managed to invoke these feelings within me, with so minimal a brushstroke and colour palette? How is it that the painter has captured an experience of mine that once felt like mine alone, and so strikingly? By that same virtue, how is it that the painting has connected me to a collective memory? These questions come back to the marvels of painting, as it transcends our traditional understandings of relationality. In the distance between the painting and I, I simultaneously stand in the place of a million viewers before me, while having an intimate history of my own with the painting that looks back at me. The silent prowess of the painting, in its ability to look back at us and challenge us, obscures the relationship between perceiver and the perceived. No fore, no ground. Just limitless possibility for connection. Moses Zibor, Broken egg, rooster and golden fish, 2022, Price on request, ENQUIRE</description>

      <description>RESERVOIR presents a new a solo exhibition by Bella Knemeyer Bella Knemeyer in studio, photography credit: Jonathan Kope -------------- RESERVOIR presents Here, there and everywhere, a solo exhibition by South African artist Bella Knemeyer. The opening event took place on Thursday, 13 February 2025, and the exhibition runs until 28 March 2025. Enclosed is an excerpt of the exhibition text, The promise of repair by Hedley Twidle. At some point in the last ten years, human-made things – infrastructure, concrete, metals, asphalts, aggregates, plastics and all the rest – began to exceed the combined weight of all biomass on earth. Exactly where you place the crossover point depends: are we counting only things constructed (bridges, roads, buildings)? Or also the waste left behind after their making: mine dumps, tailings, landfill, scrapyards, piles of rubble? In 1900 (scientists estimate) human-made stuff clocked in at 3% of organic matter (everything from trees to tundra, cattle to plankton). Today human civilization weighs in at 1,1 trillion metric tonnes (the more conservative estimate). A million million tonnes, that is, pressing down on the earth’s crust, present and future. Bella Knemeyer, Pine (detail), 2025, Mulched paper with acrylic on canvas, 159.5 x 106cm, price on request, ENQUIRE In Bella Knemeyer’s work, panels of mulched paper are scored with fine striations or imbued with a delicate mesh. On shelves in her studio are pebbles of granite, dirty whitish and speckled with black grains. Or at least this is what I took them for, until I pick one up and find it unaccountably light. Also formed of papier-mâché, mixed with slate chips picked up from the railway that runs to Simonstown (where her studio is located, looking over the station, the naval dockyards and the glittering metal sheet of False Bay beyond). There are also delicate arrangements of wire with fulcrums, counterweights, like scales or seesaws; and cylinders (also paper) hanging down like those from an old pendulum clock. The combined mass of this entire body of work, I imagine, would be negligible. Even when including the small grey panels pitted with imperfections and scored with wire: portable diptychs and triptychs of concrete that remind you just how beautiful this material can be. Bella Knemeyer solo exhibition, Installation shot, courtesy of RESERVOIR ‘Materials change shape as they travel from geological deposit or forest or factory and design project to landfill’ – so writes Jane Hutton in Reciprocal Landscapes, her attempt to move back and forth between distant production site and designed landscape, to trace itineraries of the things that make up our profoundly altered world: ‘Where did they come from? What are the social and ecological conditions of their manufacture? Who made them? What is left in their place?’ The exponential growth of the built environment across the 20th and 21st centuries – an irruption of technosphere into biosphere – has happened largely within living memory (particularly following the so-called Great Acceleration post-second world war, with its large-scale adoption of concrete, crude oil derivatives and asphalt). We live within its consequences at every turn; yet somehow it is hard to believe, to imagine or take as entirely real. Bella Knemeyer, This world should be more wonderful, 2025, Mulched paper with acrylic on canvas, 130 x 100cm, price on request, ENQUIRE The unthinkable weight of this world historical process – its complex and unceasing flows of extraction, fabrication, deconstruction, beneficiation, displacement, dumping and disposal – haunts Knemeyer’s work, but in a subtle, sublimated way. The quiet delicacy of her panels and maquettes exist in an inverse or indexical relation to the flows they point to: the frenzied demolition and construction in capitalist core nations or growing urban hubs.

      <title>The market for &apos;affordable art&apos; heats up</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/the-market-for-affordable-art-heats-up</link>
      <description>- By Mary Corrigall ----------- The phrase “affordable art” has a complex history within the art market. Local and international art fairs that have, at various times, attached &quot;affordable&quot; to their events have sometimes drawn the ire of art dealers and confused or alienated collectors. This is largely due to the relativity of the term “affordable”, depending on one’s geographical location or the economic strata. Art&apos;s value is also partly associated with its unattainability and its status as a symbol of wealth. That association continues to hold relevance, however in reality, artworks at various price points offered by galleries at different levels are the norm, making art accessible to a range of budgets. The Corrigall &amp; Co South Africa Patterns &amp; Pricing (2018) found that prices for art that year ranged from R650 to R7.8 million. Global conditions however, are shattering some of the stigma attached to affordable art. Economic uncertainty, high inflation, and the reported decline of the global art market are reportedly driving growth and interest in lower-valued art. South African art is competitively priced, and art dealers and artists with access to international markets are well placed to benefit from this shift. Locally, there is also a growing demand for more “affordable” art, which is increasing the number of art buyers, though it may be challenging for more established artists who rely on local sales. There is always a positive side to a market downturn. The global art market remains healthy, with an estimated value of $57.5 billion in 2024, according to the Art Basel UBS Art Market Report 2025, produced by Art Economics. However, the report found that art sales at auctions and by art dealers in the global art market fell by 12% in 2024. If you dig into these figures more closely, you discover that the major losses occurred at the top end of the art market, which has &quot;thinned out significantly,&quot; according to its author, Claire McAndrew. High net worth individuals are not in a rush to consign high-value artworks at auction in a market deemed to be in decline. Nor are they feeling bullish about acquiring expensive contemporary works that may not yield a healthy return at auction, if they choose to resell them. In line with this, one of the main findings in the Art Basel UBS Art Market Report 2025 is the growth in the lower end of the art market. This can be detected in the increase in sales of work below $50 000. In the American context, this could be deemed “affordable art”, although it translates to R900 000 in Rand terms. Smaller dealers worldwide, with a turnover of less than $250,000, (only 1% of responders to the Basel/UBS report are from the African continent) are benefiting from the demand for more “affordable” art, and have experienced a 17% increase in sales. This shift in the market was most noticeable at auctions where results and price transparency are made public and can be easily quantified and analysed. Arteconomics found that in 2024 the auction market for artworks valued under $5,000 experienced a 7% increase in value, and a 13% increase in the number of lots sold. Demand for art set at the $50 000 mark and below is not a new trend, however, it has been increasing since 2022 when &quot;the share of transactions for prices of below $50,000 was reported as 73% and this rose substantially by 13% in 2023, stabilising at 85% in 2024.&quot; The majority of the works that sold for under that amount were considerably less - $5000 &quot;even though they made up only 4% of sales values.” In local rand terms, this equates to works priced from R90 000 and less. This has naturally made South African art more attractive to foreign buyers, as for that sum, you can secure a good quality painting by an established artist. Emma Van der Merwe, director at Everard Read/Circa galleries (a participant in the RMB Latitudes Art Fair) recalls an American collector who acquired ten sculptures for their sculpture garden. The collector remarked that this was equivalent to the price of one sculpture by a renowned American artist. In line with this, some internationally established South African artists continue to sell well and do not feel pressured to create “more affordable” works, whether smaller or in other mediums. &quot;I am not considering sales and what might be more ‘saleable’ with regards to my practice. No need to. Big works sell,&quot; said painter Kate Gottgens. To meet the demand from French institutions, Barabara Wildenboer has been generating large-scale works at prices higher than what would be palatable locally, she says. &quot;I recently had a solo exhibition locally where the works were smaller, at lower prices, and I didn&apos;t do as well as I would have with more expensive works,&quot; added Wildenboer. Frances Goodman&apos;s sequin “paintings”, which are considered expensive by local standards, continue to attract buyers. She suggests that tailoring works to make art that is less expensive isn&apos;t always a successful endeavou Frances Goodman, Red Horizon, 2023, Hand Stitched Sequins on Canvas, 136 x 184,5 x 7cm, image courtesy of the artist &quot;When I’ve made cheaper or edition pieces with the idea of making my work more affordable and readily available, it hasn&apos;t necessarily landed that way. People are not interested in buying pieces that are smaller or affordable just for the sake of it,&quot; she adds. Turiya Magadlela is known for her large-scale textile works made from pantyhose and has an established international market. Yet, she has experienced a lull in the demand for her works. To counter this, she began offering works on paper. &quot;I’ve been selling pages from my A3 sketchbook, they’re moving slowly. My large works, even the ones that some institutions have promised to buy, remain unsold. I want to be positive, but it’s hard,&quot; says Magadlela. Turiya Magadlela, Tembeka Akukhontombi engiyithandayo II, R1,800.00 ex. VAT, Latitudes Limited Print, Archival Giclee Print on Felix Schoeller True Fibre 200gsm, BUY NOW The rise in sales of lower-valued works at auction, which was identified in the UBS/Basel report, hasn’t been noticeable locally. Strauss &amp; Co Auction house hasn’t seen a marked increase “in the sales of lower-priced works per se, but what we have observed, is a steady growth—20% over the last four years—in new collectors entering the market. These collectors tend to start more cautiously, typically with lower-priced works such as a work on paper, and gradually move towards higher-value acquisitions as their confidence grows,” says Bina Genovese, director at Strauss. In an effort to cater to new collectors, Strauss &amp; Co has been offering monthly online art auction, providing “an accessible entry point, offering a wide range of works across price bands and mediums, which continues to support this growth in early-stage collecting,” says Genovese. Some South African gallerists are experiencing a demand for lower-priced art. Van der Merwe affirms this shift in the market, yet she is mindful that the notion of &quot;affordable artwork” is constantly changing. WORLDART gallery, a smaller gallery in Cape Town participating in the upcoming RMB Latitudes Art Fair, has also noticed an increase in the demand for lower-priced works. To cater to this, founder and director, Charl Bezuidenhout, typically presents a range of works at various price points in his exhibitions and art fair presentations. Tafadzwa Masudi, Tandavara serunyemba, 2025 presented by by WORLDART, R68,000.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE Joburg-based Karin Preller, an independent artist who will present a booth of her work at the RMB Latitudes art fair, hasn&apos;t set out to produce more affordable works. However, she has received &quot;numerous requests from buyers for smaller or more affordable works,&quot; she says. Andrew Kayser, an established independent artist based in Joburg, has found it challenging to secure beneficial gallery representation. This may have hampered sales of his large-scale paintings (sometimes up to 1,40-metres long), and he is contemplating reducing the size of his canvases to make his work more accessible. &quot;Artists, galleries, and platforms are becoming more intentional about price accessibility. There’s a growing understanding that cultivating a future market means engaging collectors early—and that means offering work at entry-level price points,&quot; observes Sara Hallatt, founder of Africa Collect, a new enterprise that finances art purchases for under R50 000. &quot;Africa Collect was born from a deep recognition that while the contemporary art market in Africa is growing, it still largely excludes a broad base of potential collectors—particularly younger and middle-class buyers,&quot; says Hallatt. Has this demand for lower-valued works resulted in galleries and collectors favouring emerging artists over bigger, more established names, driving a shift in exhibition and art fair programmes? Everard Read mostly represents mid-career and established artists, but they have always tried to include emerging artists. &quot;You want to give young artists an opportunity and a platform to create an entry-level market space that caters to both new collectors and established collectors, local and international,&quot; observes Van der Merwe. With this in mind, the Cape Town gallery stages the “cubicle” series, providing an opportunity for a group of emerging artists (of varying ages and stages) to showcase their work in this respected gallery for two weeks. Andrew Kayser, 54 1st Street, 2023, R205,000.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE The gallery makes a conscious effort to offer works by emerging artists at local and international art fairs. At the recent ExpoChicago, a US-based fair that has become important to a range of South African dealers, sales were slower than usual. In line with the Basel report, sales were more robust in the lower bracket – priced at $50 000 and under. Van der Merwe found the mood sombre, and it was the work of Warren Maroon, an emerging Cape Town-based artist, that excited buyers. Interest in emerging artists from Africa is not new. It may have less to do with economics, and more to do with the cultural diversity and compelling narratives that underpin art from our continent. The quality of art from South Africa, in relation to the prices artists demand, is attractive. Galleries and artists operating between local and international markets will have to balance two different concepts of “affordability” without compromising on artistic values. Dealer are likely going to look to support more emerging artists to meet local demand for lower valued works. This could only benefit our art ecosystem where emerging artists outnumber established names.</description>

      <title>Invictus Capital&apos;s NFT Lab Launches the First NFT Collection of African Art</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/invictus-capitals-nft-lab-launches-the-first-nft-collection-of-african-art</link>
      <description>Invictus Capital&apos;s NFT Lab Launches the First NFT Collection of African Art A pioneer in the digital asset space, Invictus Capital has unveiled its first NFT (non-fungible token) collection through the Invictus NFT Lab which combines African fine art with blockchain technology. “The global pandemic has been especially challenging for creatives worldwide, with fine artists particularly hard hit by gallery closures, curtailed travel and canceled exhibitions,” says Brett Bellairs from 131 A Gallery. In the face of these challenges, many digital artists have embraced the opportunity to engage with the fast-growing community of NFT collectors. But artists who make physical works have been left behind. At the same time, traditional art collectors have struggled to see the value proposition of ownership rights to a publicly-accessible digital file. The Out of Africa Collection by the Invictus NFT Lab bridges this gap in that it&apos;s an NFT collection that includes curated artworks in physical form from a range of professional fine artists at the top of their game. Collectors will bid on NFT representations of the original, physical artworks. These NFTs act like a certificate of ownership that allows the holder to have the physical artwork delivered to them, if they wish. The NFT representations will often incorporate animation, or other augmented reality features made possible by digitization. The collection is made up of 100 curated, unique NFTs by top Southern African artists backed by (and redeemable for) physical artworks across a range of mediums. The project is a first foray into the NFT space for most of the participating artists and will introduce their work to a global crypto market. “This inaugural collection is a first of its kind for Southern African artists, and global investors,” says Daniel Schwartzkopff, CEO at Invictus Capital. The strength of Southern Africa&apos;s diversity in culture and artistic style shines throughout the collection; from Robert Slingsby’s use of ancient geometry to celebrate African heritage to Blessing Ngobeni’s brave sociopolitical commentary to Olivié Keck’s pop culture-inspired whimsy. &quot;This collection is a triumph for these artists and represents some of the finest new, upcoming and established talent,” says Marelize van Zyl, Curator for the Out of Africa NFT collection. For collectors, NFTs make it possible to cut out significant middleman costs that can make investing in art otherwise unpalatable. “For artists, NFTs give them access to a truly global audience and a royalty-driven revenue model made possible by blockchain,” says Charl Bezuidenhout of WorldART. The project kicks off in January, with the distribution of NFT posters to interested parties, and will culminate in an auction in February for NFT representations of the original artworks. The auctions will be facilitated by the OpenSea NFT market, the world’s largest and most trusted NFT resale platform. The Invictus NFT Lab is an example of Invictus Capital&apos;s imperative to disrupt traditional investment and financial services. &quot;We believe that an NFT Lab, like this one, will go a long way to bringing NFTs into mainstream investment portfolios, and appeal to traditional art collectors; modern NFT collectors and anyone in between”, says Schwartzkopff. Prospective investors interested in the project can subscribe to the newsletter to get updates on participating artists and artworks, as well as concrete dates for each project phase. The technical details can be found in the Litepaper , and the project’s progress can be tracked via Twitter or Instagram .</description>

      <description>Art Exhibitions To View Over The Holidays As the year comes to an end, the art agenda shows no signs of slowing down. The Latitudes team has rounded up what shows to see these holidays. Be sure to check gallery opening times before you head out. ------------------------------ Alexander Kibble, Gyata , 2020. R 5,600.00 ex. vat. Presented by Eclectica Contemporary. KZN: KZNSA Gallery BUZZART21 - CARE 3 December 2021 - 16 January 2022 As the world seeks to heal from the trauma of Covid-19, it has never been more important that we care for ourselves, each other, our communities and our planet. KZNSA’s annual BUZZART exhibition is themed CARE and explores this by inviting proposals for the widest interpretation of this theme as we enter a season of gifting, generosity and support of local livelihoods. It has been a time of great uncertainty for local design and craft practitioners and the festive season is a chance to recover and rebuild. BUZZART is KZN’s biggest local-only Christmas fair. In conjunction with BUZZART21, the annual KZNSA Members’ Exhibition will be on show. Reflecting on the theme of CARE, the exhibition visually explores considerations of consciousness, mindfulness and empathy as we take pause to reflect on the pandemic and our ‘new normal’.

Cape Town: Conrad Botes, The Heretic Manifesto, 2021. 131 A Gallery The Anatomy Lesson - Conrad Botes 7 December 2021 - 21 January 2022 131 A Gallery is pleased to present ‘The Anatomy Lesson’ a solo exhibition of paintings, photo drawings, silkscreen prints and sculpture by acclaimed South African artist Conrad Botes. This is his first solo exhibition at 131 and 21st solo overall in his career. The online exhibition will be live on our site from the 7th of December until the 21st of January and the works will be up at the gallery from Saturday the 11th of December. Images of dead bodies have been used throughout history as a tool for political and religious propaganda. Starting from the time of the Roman crucifixions, and placed in popular culture throughout modern history and more recently in an impactful experience that the artist recalls from the late 80s in South Africa where fallen MK (Mkhonto weSizwe) soldiers were prominently displayed on the Apartheid government news. Throughout the last two decades, Conrad Botes has been recording many of these images by means of sketchbook drawings in an attempt to gather evidence and material for this ongoing study of state-sanctioned shock-imagery used in the mainstream media throughout the ages. For more information, click here . Tashinga Majiri, Maoko neShanduko (Hands of Change) 2, 2021 THK Gallery Embodied Cognition - Tashinga Majiri, Nyasha Marovatsanga, Lulama Wolf 4 November 2021 - 31 December 2021 The artists in ‘Embodied Cognition’ possess a unique visual language. Bypassing the linear, they use ambiguity and suggestion to create new metaphors and ways of seeing. They draw on a complex network of association – here a colour, there a familiar shape – to appeal to the subconscious, with layered and intuitive references. For more information, click here . LegakwanaLeo Makgekgenene, Mokapelo Portrait, 2021. Eclectica Contemporary Truth Be Told 2 December 2021 - 31 January 2022 Recorded history is foremost the story of conquerors. Real history is something different. We have invited two multidisciplinary African artists, Williams Chechet (Nigeria) and LegakwanaLeo Makgekgenene (Botswana), to investigate narratives and contested African histories through a digital lens.With titles such as Watch The Throne and What is your Dream , Chechet’s artworks become sites of disruption and interrogation of historical iconography. Recycling logos, text and images from popular culture, Chechet’s images are deliberately taken out of context and overlapped with accessories that invite the viewer to decode and decipher complex colonial histories. For more information, click here . Neue Times Friends of Friends and Eclectica Gallery presented ‘Neue Times’, a pop up exhibition in Cape Town on the 2nd of December. Now find all the works on Latitudes . 99 Loop A solo presentation by Mboma 1 December 2021 - 22 January 2022 Displayed in public for the first time are ‘Drum Boys’ and ‘Pondo’, two recent bodies of work by Mboma. In these series of digital works, the artist introduces us to consciousness and introspection of the angst of addiction and the historiography of black South Africa. Mboma’s execution of style informs aspects of loneliness, dejection and dream states, calling reference to recognisable iconography from social, literary, and art history.

Escape Island Right Now! - Chris Denovan 1 December 2021 - 22 January 2022 Emerging from the miasma of the pandemic, Chris Denovan invites you to search beyond your isolated cave, where X marks the spot on an imagined map. ‘ Escape Island Right Now!’ acts as a vessel on which the artist asks you to climb aboard and set off on a voyage to a new world, a better world, a fantasy island paradise. For more information, click here . Dan Halter, Colonial Monopoly, 2021. Whatiftheworld Get Out of Jail Free - Dan Halter 8 December 2021 - 22 January 2022 Dan Halter’s ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ in many senses is the documentation of the narratives of colonial and contemporary stories of land dispossession and the lack of consequences for those who now hold monopolies. The exhibition contains multiple voices, interweaving texts, maps, photographs, designs and formats from Monopoly that create a dialogical exposition. For more information, click here . Sanell Aggenbach, The Swan (Detail), 2021. Photograph by Matthew Bradley. The Great Lulllllll - Sanell Aggenbach 8 December 2021 - 22 January 2022 A suite of eleven paintings, Sanell Aggenbach’s The Great Lulllllll extends oblique reflections on the past year’s pause. Music lends itself as synonym to both the collected works and their shared title; the staccato ‘t’ of ‘great’ coming to rest on the closing cadence of ‘lull’. Above it, unseen, the eye-like sign that denotes a note held, a rest extended; fermata . For more information, click here . Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum, Tangle, 2009. Goodman Gallery The same space three times William Kentridge / Kudzanai Chiurai / Gerhard Marx / Grada Kilomba / Nicholas Hlobo / Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum / Remy Jungerman 18 December 2021 - 26 January 2022 Goodman Gallery is pleased to present The same space three times, a group exhibition that considers the presence of cycles in our natural and constructed environment.

WorldART Sartorial - Sotiris Moldovanos 9 December 2021 - 19 January 2022 The theme for Sotiris Moldovanos’ latest series, ‘Sartorial’, examines men’s style and fashion as experienced on social media platforms curated by digital influencers. Both posts showing personal style and sponsored posts are appropriated directly from its feed, re-worked and presented as an authentic experience. The confusion created by the abstraction and optical illusion presents a reflection of our experience when scrolling through similar feeds on our devices. For more information, click here .

Ferva - Kilmany-Jo Liversage 2 December 2021 - 23 December 2021 Kilmany-Jo Liversage is a fixture on the South African figurative painting scene. With FERVA, her latest solo show with WORLDART, she continues to explore large-scale portraiture and still-life painting in her signature spray paint and acrylic style.

Everard Read Oasis: 25th Anniversary Group Exhibition 3 December 2021 - 31 December 2021 Everard Read Cape Town is proud to celebrate our 25th anniversary in 2021. Our annual summer exhibition for this milestone year will showcase a range of work which represents the gallery’s dynamic identity. This includes painting and sculpture from leading contemporary artists, emerging younger creatives, and those sadly no longer with us who were instrumental in the shaping of this gallery. Titled ‘Oasis’, the exhibition frames our ambitions and intentions for our gallery, namely to be an oasis in many senses – a sanctuary, as well as a confluence; a meeting place where ideas are shared; a watering hole for thirsty souls; a permanent place for the transitory, and transitory place for the permanent. For more information, click here . Johannesburg: Boemo Diale, Hype Woman on red vase. the gallery, 44 Stanley RE-FORM - curated by Balekane Legoabe 20 November 2021 - January 2022 Reform refers to the making of changes for the purpose of improvement. To reconstruct a thing from the sum of its parts in order to make it better. To reimagine and restructure. Artists were invited to produce an artwork in any medium, exploring the notion of reform. The exhibition looks at the ways in which artists whose work overlaps or is integrated into the fields of graphics, animation and design respond to the need or desire for a reconfiguration of the status quo. The show features a variety of artworks in various mediums, including illustration, painting, photography, 3D animation and printmaking. For more information: info@theatelier.co.za Koooooos, Cat Eye, 2021. David Krut Projects Creature Feature 6 November 2021 - 29 January 2022 &apos;Creature Feature&apos; is a group exhibition exploring the human-animal bond, the relationship between humans and other animals throughout history, and celebrating the significance that our beloved pets bring to our lives. The works on show include prints, paintings, drawings, photographs and ceramic works. For more information, click here . View the show on Latitudes . Andrzej Urbanski Everard Read Irregular - Andrzej Urbanksi 18 November 2021 - 22 December 2021 Andrzej Urbanski playfully negotiates perfect applications and concrete designs with a focused ability that manifests fresh and pertinent abstract experimentation. He employs the unconventional spray paint medium in his abstract painting, as it produces flat colour and removes any trace of the &apos;artist&apos;s hand&apos;. Urbanski&apos;s authenticity lies in his desire and ambition to secure the perfect surface - one which balances richness of colour and movement of &apos;frequency&apos; across a two-dimensional language. For more information, click here . Paulo Nazareth, Intaka Esefestileni, 2021 STEVENSON INTAKA ENDALA EPHEZU’ KOMKHOMBE OMHLOPHE - Paulo Nazareth 27 November 2021 - 28 January 2022 Comprising sculpture, installation, drawing, photography and painting, using both naturally occurring and artificial materials, ‘INTAKA ENDALA EPHEZU’ KOMKHOMBE OMHLOPHE’ spotlights the interplay of paradoxes between the immediate needs of life and the assumed requirements of a modernity governed by global white supremacy. The title of this exhibition translates from isiXhosa as ‘an old bird on top of a white rhinoceros’, an idiom that speaks about symbiosis, questioning what is perceived as valuable and what is designated parasitic. In exploring this notion Nazareth uses the maize crop as a foundational metaphor. For more information, click here . Clive van den Berg, African Landscape V, 2016. Goodman Gallery Underscape - Clive van den Berg 20 November 2021 - 15 January 2022 Following Clive Van den Berg’s recent survey at the KwaZulu Natal Society of Arts, Goodman Gallery is pleased to present Underscape, a cross-section of paintings by the artist that considers the “distemper” of our lived experience in relation to landscape.

      <title>Crafting a ‘museum’ worthy African art collection</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/crafting-a-museum-worthy-african-art-collection</link>
      <description>Crafting a &apos;museum&apos; worthy African art collection Mary Corrigall takes a close look at the collecting patterns of three renowned public museums to discover which African artists enjoy institutional validation in New York, London and Paris. Do public museums carry as much power, since private art museums started driving exhibition programming and snagging the most sought-after works? Installation photograph of Zanele Muholi Exhibition, Tate Modern, November 2020, Photo by Christian Fregnan via Unsplash Of all the rhetoric employed by gallerists and art dealers to persuade someone to buy an artwork, the most convincing pivots on an artist’s work being acquired by museums. Unfortunately, in the context of selling contemporary African art, this tactic carries far more weight if the museum is located in a western art centre. Museum or institutional validation is seen as so vital that artists CVs or biographies almost always indicate which collections or institutions have acquired their works. Given that most of the main international public and private art museum collections can be viewed online, art buyers are no longer have to rely on in-person encounters with works – which often never make it out of storage – but can nose about and see which African artists have garnered institutional validation. Interestingly –collections at public African museums are not available online. If you had to build a collection - call it the ultimate African museum collection - based on the artworks produced by African artists that have been acquired by the Tate in London, MoMA in New York and say, The Centre Pompidou in Paris, which artists and works would feature in it? A brief study of the works produced by African artists in these three most renowned museums in western art centres revealed, not unexpectedly, that the majority of the works were made by artists from South Africa. Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Ghana are ranked behind SA in 2 nd , 3 rd ,4 th , 5 th place respectively. Of the South African artists that are collected by all three of these world renowned museums are; William Kentridge, David Goldblatt, Zanele Muholi, Guy Tillim, Marlene Dumas, Ernest Cole, Sue Williamson and Ian Wilson, who might not be known to South Africans as he forged his career largely in the US. Egyptian artists that have works in all three museums are; Sameer Makarius and Anna Boghiguian. Nigerian based, but Ghanian born, El Anatsui and John Akomfrah have works in these museums as does Morocco’s Yto Barrada and Mohammed Melehi. Algiers’ Jean-Michel Atlan, Cameroon’s Barthélémy Toguo, and Ethiopian born Julie Mehretu naturally also enjoy institutional validation by these museums. You would need to be a fairly moneyed collector to snag a work by most of these artists, though with the South African photography based artists such as Tillim, Cole and Williamson you could secure a relatively affordable editioned work. South African photographic works appear to be collectable yet – apart from those works made by Goldblatt – are not highly valued on the art market. In other words, a ‘museum’ worthy collection might not always be one that would do well at auction. Otobong Nkanga, (1974, Nigeria), at the Centre Pompidou , The Weight of Scars , Photo credits: © Philippe Migeat - Centre Pompidou, MNAM-CCI /Dist. RMN-GP, Image reference : 4N82267, Image presentation : l&apos;Agence Photo de la RMN A number of the artists listed above - Dumas, Mehretu, Akomfrah, Toguo - and those that appear in two of these museums’ collections such as Robin Rhode, Candice Breitz, Moshekwa Langa, Otobong Nkanga, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Pascale Marthine Tayou, Sammy Baloji, Wangechi Mutu and Lubaina Himid are settled outside of Africa. This suggests that those artists more likely to enjoy institutional validation in western art centres are more embedded in them. Given the repeated commonalities between the works by African artists in the collections of the Tate, MoMA and Pompidou evinces a shared awareness among the acquisitions boards on which artists’ works should be collected. As such it appears that taste in art, even in the realm of museums, is as circular as it might be in the art market, where the same names keep reappearing and there are discernible waves of interest in certain artists at certain times. Call it herd buying mentality. Why is it that museum validation counts for so much and should art buyers assiduously collect works by artists on whom they confer recognition? One of the main reasons institutional validation is thought to carry so much influence is perhaps, ironically, due to the fact that museums are thought to be divorced from the commercial activities of the art world. Being at a remove from commerce, has situated institutions as objective purveyors of art and taste of it. As museum gatekeepers are thought to be harder to please their ‘judgement is seldom questioned’, suggests Don Thompson in The 12 million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art (2008). Of course, the idea that museums are at a remove from art market may be somewhat of a utopian notion, particularly in countries where there are low if any government funding for acquisitions. This may partly explain why state-owned museums in African countries carry little influence in the market for contemporary African art - expanding their collection depends on collectors donating works but also on galleries and artists donating them. Brought to its knees, the state funded Joburg Art Gallery in that South African city participated in an online art fair last year, offering works by emerging artists for sale. On the face of it they appeared like any dealer. Did their backing add kudos to those artists? Candice Breitz, Him + Her, 1968-2008, Two seven-channel video installations (color, sound), 28:50 min. and 23:56 min, Credit: Gift of Outset Contemporary Art Fund, Copyright: Courtesy of the artist, Image from Museum of Modern Art website In the US where museums rely on private donors and acquisition boards can be populated by collectors with a vested interest in acquiring works by artists already in their own collections so as to increase their value, the notion of the museum as a veritable fortress of independent taste cut off from the art market doesn’t hold much water. Of course, the proliferation of private art museums has seen collectors establish institutions to not only underscore the value of their collections and artists they support but also because they are as “passionate about art and this is how they want to spend their money” according to András Szántó, cultural consultant. The proliferation of art foundations has worked towards driving up the price of art, with billionaires competing for desirable works for their quasi museums and it is in these kinds of spaces that the most prestigious exhibitions are being staged, according to Georgina Adam in The Rise and Rise of the Private Art Museum (2021). As such not only are private museums making it difficult for public ones to acquire art – which is now more expensive – but sometimes, undercutting their programming too. This is chipping away at the status of public museums. In South Africa, the most exciting ‘museum’ quality shows are being staged at private art foundations. Take the Joburg Contemporary Art Foundation’s recent Liminal Identities in the Global South , the first tightly curated African exhibition to bring African and South American female artists’ works into conversation. Perusing through the recent acquisitions by the Tate, MoMA and Pompidou it is clear that they are not necessarily involved in ‘building’ new artists careers but rather collecting those artists who have been validated by the art market or other institutions already. As such they could not be looked upon as ‘market leaders’ where taste in contemporary art is concerned. Pascale Marthine Tayou (Jean Apollinaire, dit), at the Centre Pompidou, (1967, Cameroun), Open Wall, 2010, Credits: © Adagp, Paris, Photo credits : © Philippe Migeat - Centre Pompidou, MNAM-CCI /Dist. RMN-GP, Image reference: 4N94575, Image presentation : l&apos;Agence Photo de la RMN The red-tape and small budgets that public museums even in France - The Centre Pompidou’s acquisition budget was €2-million in 2018 - perhaps make it impossible for them to act ‘fast’ and buy an artwork on a whim – in the manner of the private art foundation. This might be to their credit – they aren’t slaves to the fickle fashions that seem to drive the art market and ‘taste’ is determined by a board rather than that of a single collector or his or her advisors. Where does this leave collectors looking to collect works by artists who have institutional recognition? Ultimately, a single acquisition by a museum or private art museum of an artist’s work isn’t sufficient – you need to establish consensus by a number of museums. At this point the works are likely to be expensive and outdated in terms of their ‘contemporary relevance’ and it will come down to collecting those that are of a museum quality – not every work by an artist with institutional validation is worth buying.

      <title>Is Paris headed for another golden art era?</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/is-paris-headed-for-another-golden-art-era</link>
      <description>Is Paris headed for another golden art era? The recent announcement of Art Basel staging a Paris fair has fuelled speculation around the rise of this European art capital. What will the impact be on the African art market, which has developed in that city? Gagosian, Jack Shainman Gallery, Meleko Mokgosi, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel Pre-war Paris has been a source of nostalgia for art lovers. It is the spectre of France’s golden art era that compels streams of tourists to Montparnasse to do a turn in the bars – La Rotonde, Le Dôme or La Coupole – that were frequented by the heroes of western art; Picasso, Braque, Gauguin, Chagall and Kandinsky. The now cancelled filmmaker Woody Allen transferred this fantasy to celluloid in the 2011 film Midnight in Paris . In it Owen Wilson plays the bumbling writer who steps into one of these Montparnasse bars and finds himself magically transported back in time, rubbing shoulders with the art intelligentsia of Paris’s pre-war era. He seems to squander this opportunity – asking inane questions about his love life. The announcement last week that the Art Basel brand, owned by the MCH Group, will launch a fair in Paris in the venue, the Grand Palais, that had been occupied by the FIAC contemporary art fair, has fuelled further speculation that Paris is due to reclaim its historical status. Indeed it is Paris’ pre-war history that attracted Art Basel to this city. Art Basel in Basel 2021, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel ‘With its incomparable history and contemporary dynamism, Paris is uniquely positioned as a pivotal epicenter (stet) of the international cultural scene,’ stated Marc Spiegler, global director of Art Basel in a press release. ‘We aim to build on Paris’s unparalleled standing as a global metropolis to help create a vibrant week that even further amplifies the city’s international resonance as a cultural capital.’ Art Basel, are, of course, the largest global art fair franchise with fairs in Basel, Hong Kong and Miami. As their success is attributed to the company’s ‘timing&apos;, this move seems to have further added to speculation that Paris was ‘becoming important’ again as London’s status has been waning due to Brexit. Through the lens of the African art market, certainly, Paris is looming as a vital art capital with two French auction houses establishing dedicated contemporary art sales and the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair staging a Paris edition last year. They are planning another one in April of this year. Can an art capital’s importance be gleaned through the status of the fairs or amount of them staged in it? London’s Frieze Art Fair, which started in 2003, was the culmination of what some consider to be London’s ‘Golden Age’, which according to Melanie Gerlis in The Art Fair Story: A Rollercoast Ride , was linked to the rise of a new entrepreneurial class and a booming banking industry, which generated new collectors with an appetite for art that reflected their times and identity. Think of the YBA’s with their cheeky ‘working-class’ aesthetic tied into a sort of punk conceptualism. Rumours that London’s status as one of Europe’s primary art capitals is diminishing only seems to have coincided with Brexit as it would bring to end the free movement of goods from that country to the rest of Europe. In this way London would no longer operate as a nexus to reach European art collectors or to conversely, acquire art made elsewhere in Europe. This is the perception. Art Basel in Basel 2021, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel The UK continues to claim 20% of the art market share with France only securing 6%, according to the UBS Art Market Report 2021. Auction records also suggested that London sales were attracting the more important works, that could or should have been sold in Paris. “On 23 March 2021, Christie’s sold, three key works from the Paris collection of Claude Hersaint (signed Miro, Magritte and Ernst) in London for a total of $31 million,&quot; observed Thierry Ehrmann, founder of Artmarket.com. A similar pattern emerges when you review the kinds of works that come up in dedicated contemporary and modern sales of African art in London in relation to those at the Paris auction houses. In Corrigall &amp; Co’s Modern &amp; Contemporary African Art Auctions 2020/2021 Report , it was found that the turnover of dedicated sales at London-based auction houses (Sotheby’s and Bonhams) outstripped those in Paris, conducted by Piasa and ArtCurial. However, in the period January 2020 to June 2021, there were 7 auctions held in London opposed to four in Paris. Similarly, the most valuable modernist works tend to go under the hammer in London and South Africa – mostly all Irma Stern works – than in Paris. However, within the African art market, the French tend to more highly value modernist and contemporary works that are made by artists from their former colonies – such as Morocco. However, one of the most prized modern artists from that country, Mohamed Melehi’s work has fetched, on average higher prices at Sotheby’s in London, opposed to sales of his work by Artcurial in Paris. Art Basel in Basel 2021, © Art Basel, Courtesy Art Basel Perhaps a close look at the number of galleries dedicated to African art in these two European capitals can shed some more light on this rivalry. In this area they are almost neck on neck, with 17 galleries based in London opposed to 15 in Paris. Paris also now boasts two art fairs dedicated to contemporary African art, AKAA – Also Known as Africa Art Fair – established a fair in that city in 2016, and there is now also 1-54’s Paris edition. The former usually takes place in November, so it will be interesting to see if it will take place in October – to coincide with the Art Basel’s Paris edition. As Frieze London and 1-54 London take place in October in that titular city as well, will collectors, gallerists and art lovers be forced to choose between Paris and London? Only a very few African-based galleries participate in Art Basel and Frieze fairs, which have set high bars in-terms of gatekeeping. Which one will they participate in? Will the London-based auction houses with departments dedicated to African art timed sales in Paris to tie in with the new Basel Paris edition? Bonhams has introduced a Paris sale to coincide with AKAA in 2021. Ultimately, the strengthening of Paris as a capital for art can only benefit the African art market, as it is already a centre for the sale of works from the continent.

      <description>One artist’s hustle fuelling another’s Over the last decade, we&apos;ve seen artists do more than just make work - they&apos;ve built networks, platforms and possibilities. In short, they&apos;ve hustled . Not only creating opportunities for themselves, but also for those around them. It&apos;s a defining feature of today&apos;s art world. This week, we spotlight three artist-led spaces that are reimagining what support looks like. Occupying the Gallery, image courtesy of the collective ---------------- Still Art Named in homage to Ayana V Jackson’s paternal grandmother, Still Art is an artist residency program focused on emerging Southern African contemporary artists of all disciplines. Founded by South Africa based American artist Ayana V Jackson, Still Art is a decades old dream fulfilled. The residency offers artists a three month stay in the Ellis House Artist Building in Johannesburg’s Central Business District. In addition to their studio and living space the Artist receive a stipend for materials, transportation and a modest honorarium. Up to two artists per quarter will share the two adjoining 3000 sq. ft studio spaces. Our aim is to create mental and physical space for the creative process to flow uninterrupted by offering the stillness of mind and body. Watch and find out more here . Still from video snippet about Still Live residency programme, courtesy of the website Occupying the Gallery Occupying the Gallery is a visual arts based project space, mentorship/support programme, mobile studio, collective and artist residency established in July 2023 by artist’s Mary Sibande and Lawrence Lemaoana. Its core function is to ‘occupy’ galleries/institutions, alongside emerging artists, to produce experimental visual arts showcases in collaboration with relevant arts and culture orientated partners. The main pillar of Occupying the Gallery are the ‘Occupants’. This is the title given to young and emerging (and often unrepresented) artists that ‘Occupy’ mentors, collaborates with and guides through our projects and programmes. Founded with the belief that art should be a living, evolving experience, the collective focuses on creating spaces where boundaries between artist, audience, and environment are constantly shifting. By transforming traditional gallery spaces into immersive, interactive experiences, Occupying the Gallery invites viewers to not just observe, but to actively engage and participate in the creation of art.

Through these projects and programmes we aim to bridge the gap of knowledge and access between emerging artists and industry/economical/entrepreneurial success in the local art landscape and beyond. Blessing Ngobeni Art Prize (BNAP) Foundation BNAP Foundation is an NPO that aims to address the needs of emerging artists to be able to sustain themselves in the art industry through residencies. Their objective is to professionally incubate emerging artists through various workshops for business and creative development. BNAP Foundation aim to promote visual arts in South Africa while encouraging international networking and learning through exchange. BNAP Foundation at RMB Latitudes 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy Their goal is to expand our program and award globally by collaborating with international art organizations. They envision the BNAP Foundation participating in art fairs and coordinating exhibitions with art galleries and other institutions to create diverse activities, exposure for visual artists, and visibility for the BNAP Award. As a Non-Profit Organization BNAP welcomes collaborations that assist us to raise funds to ensure the sustainability of the organization. The Blessing Ngobeni Art Prize is aimed at assisting young and emerging visual artists to launch their careers in the art industry. The award acknowledges excellence in emerging artists (under 35) specializing in either sculpture, drawing and painting, performance or mixed media and provides an opportunity to showcase their talents to a broader audience. The artist is provided with studio space, materials budget, a stipend throughout the term of their residencies, guided workshops and a funded solo exhibition after the residency ends. BNAP Foundation is sponsored by Art Angels, Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and Everard Read Gallery Cape Town.</description>

      <title>Curator Spotlight on Phendu Kuta</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/curator-spotlight-on-phendu-kuta</link>
      <description>CURATOR SPOTLIGHT A spotlight on independent curator Phendu Kuta and a collaborative project with photographer Obakeng Molepe Image credits: Andile Buka Among her various media features, she has been identified as one of 50 Black African female entrepreneurs to watch by Entrepreneur magazine and was also a participant of International Colloquium &quot;Culture for the Future&quot; an initiative by the European Commission. As a creative director and curator, Phendu Kuta is passionate about collaborating with creatives to create compelling visual stories that document the southern African creative and cultural landscape. In her explorations of how storytelling can be used as a tool of empowerment, Phendu has watched, documented and written about culture and fashion for years and has gained insights into South African culture and identity. After a highly successful initial collaboration of The Hair Story, Phendu and Obakeng Molepe have recently released a second project. The new body of work showcases the South African youth subcultures, amapantsula and izikhothane . Image credits: Keketso Pii Obakeng Molepe (b. 1994, South Africa) is known for his portraiture, fashion photography and unique approach to documentary work. His work aims to challenge people’s predispositions and the many constructs that exist around us —whether it’s religion, love, time or masculinity. His aim is to tell the other side of the story. After a highly successful initial collaboration of The Hair Story, Phendu and Obakeng Molepe have recently released a second project. The new body of work showcases the South African youth subcultures, amapantsula and izikhothane . One of the country’s longest-surviving subcultures, the pantsula emerged in the 1950s in Johannesburg townships and it is widely documented that its emergence was a response to the forced removals implemented by the apartheid government shortly after its rise to power. Amapantsula are mainly recognised for their signature dance isipantsula , a syncopated and quick-stepping form of dance with origins from Marabi - a popular genre of music in the 1920s and 1930s that influenced South African jazz, style and dance, becoming a lifestyle in its own right. Featured in this body of work are members of Soweto-based dance crew Intellectuals Pantsula. Latitudes recently installed Subcultures at Liberty Two Degrees’s head office in Sandton, Johannesburg, where it will be on show for 3 months. Subcultures is also on its way to London, where it will be on show for 18 months. Details to follow.</description>

      <title>Recording what the media can&apos;t</title>

      <description>Recording what the media can&apos;t - By Mary Corrigall Sue Williamson, Truth Games (detail shot), courtesy Iziko South African National Gallery ---------- The made-for-streaming HBO film Mountainhead , centred on a group of despicable billionaires gathering at one of their OTT lairs, was made in record time. Jesse Armstrong, the creator of Succession, pitched the concept in December last year, it was filmed in March and then released in May. There may have been financial benefits to its swift production. Still, largely the wide-held view is that the film company wanted to capitalise on the anti-billionaire sentiment that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos had been generating via their various public-facing antics. There is an expectation that art should reflect reality, but as the example of Mountainhead proves, what happens when the news cycle is likely to outpace art production and more significantly, what is the relationship between art and journalism in an age when traditional media has collapsed and has yet to find its feet in the digital era? In the South African context, where newsrooms and budgets have shrunk and there is no capacity to dig into meaty human-interest stories is there potential for visual artists to do so? These questions are interesting to consider in light of two institutional exhibitions in Cape Town; We, The People, 30 Years of Democracy at the Norval Foundation, curated by Liese Van der Watt, and I have something to tell you , a retrospective on Sue Williamson at the Iziko SA National Gallery curated by Andrew Lamprecht. They are both survey shows reflecting on and depicting social and political struggles and shifts in South Africa, a well-worn lens through which the history of South African art has been analysed. During the apartheid years – artists might have had more freedom than journalists to tell stories due to government press censorship, allowing them to boldly express conditions, realities, and human rights abuses that the media could not. A Tale of Two Craddocks, by Sue Williamson, courtesy Iziko South African National Gallery It was in a journalistic capacity that Williamson witnessed the forced removals in District Six and perhaps other locations, yet her work documenting the impact of it, The Last Supper (1981) (which appears in both survey shows) was staged towards the end of those events and is evoked through an installation of rubble from the destroyed buildings. In other words, it was a retrospective act, though it weighed through the evidence - almost scientifically in the glass-encased display of the detritus. In looking at the nature of Williamson’s art and dates some of the works were produced, there is less sense that the works were intended to turn the tide of opinion or bring about change, but rather to ensure that the suffering and sacrifices that were made in the political struggle for democracy were recorded for posterity. In short, the art isn’t compelled by a journalistic compulsion – to immediately relay the facts with a short-lived impact in mind. In this way, while the journalistic mode – factual information is the grist to Williamson’s mill and she studied print media and photography in New York – her intentions and mode of delivery situate her as an artist. Her invention is in how she relays facts and makes her audience take notice of them in a meaningful way. In the work For Thirty Years Next to his Heart (1990) Williamson assembles a grid of images of a man (Mr Ngesi) taking out his ‘passbook’ a document black people were forced to carry on their person to move freely and then the stamped pages in it. The pass-laws had been scrapped in the mid-eighties before this work was created. We the People, Installation shot of viewers looking at images of Marikana, by Svea Jospehy, courtesy of Norval Foundation Most of the works by Williamson relating to the apartheid era were created in the 90s – and come after the fact and perhaps fill in the gaps of knowledge and experiences that white people might have chosen to ignore or had little awareness of due to racial divisions. This may account for the thread of duality that runs through this exhibition, where two views are juxtaposed. As Lamprecht observed in reference to the title of the survey, Williamson’s practice has pivoted on dialogue – the exchange of different views via multiple voices – this is often visually represented. In A Tale of Two Cradocks (1994), a concertina display shows tourist-friendly images of Eastern Cape Town from one side. If you approach it from the other, the tragic story of the death of the political activist Matthew Goniwe is documented. As such, her art has an interesting relationship to the journalist ethos of presenting two different views, albeit perhaps the intended message is predetermined. This blurred line between art and journalism naturally resurfaces at the We the People, 30 Years of Democracy exhibition, largely in photographic works by the usual suspects from David Goldblatt via images of black South Africans attaining ‘freedoms’ of the new era from a woman planting veggies to a man building a house, to an image of prisoner voting by Mikhael Subotzky, to Pieter Hugo&apos;s images of a poor white couple with a young black boy, to Svea Josephy’s images of the site where the Marikana tragedy took place. W e the People, Installation shot, courtesy of Norval Foundation Tellingly, in these examples it is white artists capturing the lives of black people perhaps guided by the idea that democracy entailed connecting with and shifting attention to the ordinary people who had suffered during apartheid. The medium of photography with its connection to journalism is responsible for this focus if you consider the work of prominent black photographers - Zanele Muholi, Ashley Walters, Jabulani Dlamini and Sabelo Mlangeni,Thabiso Sekgala and Sobekwa Lindokuhle - whose works in this exhibition also embraces a documentary mode and speaks to another generation interested in exploiting journalistic enquiry. In this way photography plays a role in gauging Democracy’s ‘success’ , providing verifiable records to measure the fate of South Africa’s majority in the hands of a new political dispensation. This is not only limited to photography - video works by Moshekwa Langa depicting people climbing into a bus and Steven Cohen&apos;s contentious performance in a squatter camp drive this journalistic compulsion to tell the stories of the marginalised or oppressed. However, even abstract works on this exhibition, such as Nicholas Hlobo&apos;s ribbon, leather and thread composition on canvas titled Intlambo Yochulumanco are framed via texts near the work to be representative of his experience of &quot;being a gay man in a Xhosa culture&quot;. There is a sense that the social context underpinning art in South Africa relates to its value and there is a prevailing morality underpinning art. This sharply contrasts with the democratisation of art through the art fair model, which has popularised it among different social and economic groups, leading to its commodification and less need for a social or political imperative. The new middle class is naturally keen to view their comfortable lives depicted in art manifesting most prominently in images of black people at leisure which recurred in the portraiture trend informing the late Koyo Kouoh&apos;s When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting – a narrative arc in the post-apartheid era that is absent in We, the People . A psychic and generational shift has occurred since democracy around why and how artists make work, they are more empowered to tell their own story rather than speak for the &quot;people&quot;. In this way the political is told through a personal lens and is rooted in the first person so to speak in literary terms. This is reflected in the final gallery display of We the People , where all myriads of subject-matter, subjectivities are encompassed such as a work by Tom Cullberg, a Swedish artist, whose installation of paintings document a nostalgia for another time, era, place in the face of rapid change. This cultural-turn is maybe rooted in an awareness of cultural appropriation, hyper individualism that late capitalism has inculcated but also has to do with a society that is not facing an obvious violent political conflict or an erosion of human rights. Without the freedom of expression art cannot flourish and becomes co-opted into a dialogue with a repressive state. This psychic gap between generations comes to the fore in Williamson&apos;s titular documentary filmic works capturing the dialogue between political activists from the apartheid era and their grandchildren. The exchanges are fraught with resentments and show the gaps between the apartheid and post-apartheid generations. In the dialogue between Amina and Luiza Cachalia, Luiza is angry that her grandmother has never communicated the grief and anguish of living in the apartheid era and the high personal cost of fighting it. Amina suggests that to do so would have meant to relinquish the battle. It becomes clear that all the suppressed emotions from one generation were passed on to another and that there is still much to uncover and air from our fraught history. Ultimately, what artists such as Williamson are able to do, are to bring us the facts, but also create a space for the silences between them to come to light, fusing the best of features of journalism and art.

      <title>A new generation emerges from Cape Town’s ‘lockdown’</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/a-new-generation-emerges-from-cape-town-s-lockdown</link>
      <description>A new generation emerges from Cape Town’s &apos;lockdown&apos; Image credit: THE FOURTH , got JUNK? exhibition, September 2021 It has been two years since Cape Town’s last bumper art season. Mary Corrigall takes a look at the impact of the absence of foreign visitors on Africa’s major art capital. People have been known to invent reasons to visit Cape Town. Even the most arbitrary conference holds some allure if it happens to be staged at this southernmost tip of Africa. The Clifton beaches, the mountainous vistas that beckon from even the grimiest of locations, the high concentration of chichi restaurants and, an endless array of vineyards (read wine-tastings) to explore beyond the city limits, have made this part of South Africa, and Africa, a major tourist destination. Throw in an art fair, mix in some private art museum shows, add a dash of exclusive VIP cocktail events, stir in a few art auctions, season the concoction with a depreciating local currency and, voilà you have what has fast become Africa’s hottest art capital. In the 2018 South Africa Art Market: Patterns &amp; Pricing study, it was clearly established that Cape Town was indeed the major art capital on the African continent, beating Joburg, Marrakesh and Lagos – the other contenders. Joburg might be the economic centre of the country and boast the highest number of art fairs and galleries, but Cape Town has a higher concentration of second and third-tier galleries and an art fair that draws international dealers. This is largely tied to the constant stream of foreign visitors to the city. Many galleries based in Cape Town have claimed that the largest percentage of sales have been to foreign collectors. As such, the winter season – which brings a slightly unpleasant combo of wind and rain - has proven to be a barren one for many galleries – even smaller ones that you would expect could attract local collectors. For this reason, the Covid-19 pandemic, which proved a barrier for foreign visitors - made Cape Town art dealers very jittery. “There aren’t enough local art collectors to sustain galleries here,” remarked Baylon Sandri, director of SMAC Gallery, towards the end of 2020. Indeed, a number of galleries closed – Smith, Gallery MOMO&apos;s Cape Town branch and German-based ARTCO&apos;s Cape Town space. However, the closure of these galleries wasn’t only related to the impact of the pandemic. For example; the latter had hoped to exploit the foot traffic to the Goodman, which relocated to De Waterkant. Rich Mnisi, To Reflect, Southern Guild, image by Christof van der Walt Given the reliance on foreign visitors to keep the art market in Cape Town ticking over, what has become of it in the last two years since the Investec Cape Town Art Fair staged a live event? Art-making as an activity tends to be carried out in isolation (unless you are a William Kentridge with a large team supporting your production, or a textile-based artist that relies on crafters. As such, the artists in this city had a concentrated time over the last two years to focus without any distractions on their practice. “I was happy to have time at home. I had been wanting to limit my international travel anyway, not only because of the environmental crisis but also because I was needing to work on a project that required an intimate integration of my film work and my painting process,” observed Penny Siopis, who transformed her small Cape Town apartment into a studio. With no travel getting in the way, this period proved more productive than she had anticipated. Penny Siopis, Pinky Pinky (Model Prisoners), 2002 A string of strong solo exhibitions in 2021 across the galleries in Cape Town produced by Chris Soal, Bonolo Kavula, Aviwe Plaatjie, Brett Charles Seiler, Shakil Solanki, Lyndi Sales, Luyanda Zindela, Andile Dyalvane, Kresiah Mukwazhi, Callan Grecia and Rich Mnisi, substantiated not only that artists had been prolific during the pandemic, but as this list suggests, that a largely new generation of artists also drawn from different disciplines took centre stage. This was the result of a marked shift in the gallery programming, which tended towards staging shows by younger or less proven artists. These shows were apparently cheaper to stage and with little foreign foot-traffic gallerists could keep the prices of art lower, take more risks and work at digging into appealing to locals. A focus on emerging talent was mirrored in the kind of growth experienced in the art ecosystem with new spaces opening up to accommodate them. The Fourth, Spaceby (a recent extension of The Fourth), and Jaffer Modern gallery opened alongside some new online galleries such as Plot and Escape 3 . Even Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art (MOCAA) got in on the act of promoting emerging talent rather than the usual consecrated artists, with an unprecedented show titled Home is Where the Art is , featuring art made by pretty much anyone who fancied themselves as artists in the city. They may have taken the sentiment too far, however, this rambling show was by locals for locals and broke with the Zeitz MOCAA&apos;s focus on foreign tourists. Adding to this ‘grass-roots’ turn was the opening of Church on the titular street in the city tucked into a burgeoning art node that includes the AVA, Nel, Eclectica and Worldart galleries. This new project space might have opened with a show by a well-known figure, Thania Petersen, but they have quickly lived up to their risk-taking ethos since, with a string of unconventional installations and performances by emerging talent such as Brian Montshiwa, who covered the interior walls with pink-lipstick kisses during a five-day durational performance. Church&apos;s gold facade at 58 Church Street, image courtesy: Church The notion of a non-commercial space for artists to take risks seemed to please Berni Searle, a veteran artist who has been a focus of a solo exhibition at Frieze London. Her enthusiasm is shaped by her role as an art lecturer at the University of Cape Town. Speaking at the opening of Church she observed that one of the positive outcomes from Covid 19 was the increase in “alternative and emerging spaces that are not driven by commercial ends or controlled by monopolies in the art world. There is so much emphasis placed on polished works. Our students are so influenced by the art world and feel the need to produce work that fits into the neat gallery system, it is important that we have a space to play, we need to survive but it shouldn’t be at the expense of our growth.” You could surmise that the pandemic allowed some players in Cape Town’s art world to reconnect with the source of art – experimentation and driving new forms of expression – rather than simply servicing the tastes of foreign collectors. Even first-tier galleries such as Stevenson seemed to get back in touch with their roots with two group shows, including works by artists that weren’t all in their stable. The Norval Foundation’s new gallery outpost at the Boschendal wine farm followed this trend, featuring a solo exhibit by a young artist working in ceramics, Githan Coopoo, shown alongside art superstar Zanele Muholi. This focus on emerging talent in Cape Town perhaps culminated in The 40 Under 40 exhibition organised by Whatiftheworld Gallery and staged at the Twee Jonge Gezellen Wine Estate outside Tulbagh towards the end of 2021. This rambling show, featuring all manner of works – from ceramic, installation to sound - featured most of the new rising stars that have emerged during this pandemic, alongside some new names and interesting works that previously would never have got a look in, in a group show by this gallery in the city. Zanele Muholi featured in the new gallery space at Boschendal Manor House, image courtesy: Boschendal Norval Art Gallery Of course, this week in Cape Town the tried-and-tested art stars are out on parade again as the Investec Cape Town Art Fair gives everyone a good excuse to fly in for an art feast. However, even this fair has modified its position – allowing more smaller local and new galleries to participate in it that would not have made the cut in the past.

      <description>Artist Thobile Mavuso commissioned by Thrive Student Living in partnership with Latitudes, to create a show-stopping mural Latitudes recently installed a new large-scale mural in a Johannesburg campus community. This new mural in a Johannesburg campus community reminds students where they’re from, where they’re going – and that they are not alone. Photograph courtesy of Thrive Student Living -------- Sleep, study, eat. Sleep, study, eat. Sleep, study … art? For tertiary level scholars studying in Johannesburg, far away from their roots and often with the weight of their family’s expectation on their young shoulders, the chance to find beauty and breathing space amidst the relentless learning may seem like a fanciful dream. However, at Thrive Student Living’s new Arteria Parktown 500-bed student residence, the art is right there in – even on! – their custom-built home away from home. Local poet, healer and multi-disciplinary artist Thobile Mavuso was commissioned by Thrive Student Living to create a mural for the R200-million Arteria Parktown property and designed a unique artwork that encapsulates both the displacement and excitement of student life in “res”. The piece is fittingly entitled Ukuzilanda Ukuzilandela Nokuzelapha , which loosely translates as “to return to one’s roots is to care for and heal oneself.” For artist Thobile – who is currently doing a master’s degree in Fine Art at the University of the Witwatersrand – those roots are in her Ndebele background, echoes of which are found in her vibrant yet restful mural. Painted on an internal courtyard wall in acrylic, using a palette of teal, yellow ochre, red and green, this vast piece features a circle of connected figures in traditional headdress… or perhaps a tangle of opening flowers… or perhaps a patchwork of homesteads amidst fields… Whatever, it begs to be looked at, to be contemplated. And that is precisely the point. The Arteria Parktown mural, says Thobile, explores “the wounding that comes with displacement, dispossession and landlessness that many South African people experience, which often leads to a loss of cultural identity, heritage and traditions.” Photograph courtesy of Thrive Student Living The interplay depicted between the human body and the land communicates the interconnectedness of the two, she explains. “It encourages enquiry into one’s history, roots, and imvelaphi – one’s origins – as a means of care and healing. The artwork aims to suggest that through knowing who one is they may find what they are not.” Thobile was commissioned by Thrive Student Living in consultation with Latitudes, the curated online market for art from Africa, and South Africa in particular. This collaboration was a natural one, as Latitudes’ inclusive ethos mirrors that at Thrive. Latitudes is not just a marketplace but an educational platform about and for art,” says co-founder Roberta Coci. “The difference is in our approach. We are flexible, inclusive, and insistent on equitable participation for all players, from the artists, like Thobile Mavuso, to the galleries, curators, and the collectors – many of whom first find the courage to start buying art through our open, inclusive showcase.” Thrive Student Living benefits from Growthpoint Properties’ award-winning green building initiatives and ongoing mission to create healthy, sustainable environments, with a socially conscious mandate. “We believe in lifting as we rise and endeavour to partner with members of the university community where possible,” stresses Amogelang Mocumi, Fund Manager of Growthpoint Student Accommodation, which operates Thrive Student Living. “The decision to partner with Thobile was easy given that she is a Wits student and her work resonates with what Thrive Student Living stands for.” Thrive offers tailor-made campus communities, which include study areas, games rooms, gyms, and backup power and water. Its Student Life programme offers round-the-clock support for students, encompassing everything from academic performance to physical health and mental wellness. It is this unique approach that gives parents and bursary providers peace of mind, knowing students are in a fully supportive environment. Ukuzilanda Ukuzilandela Nokuzelapha is a visual extension of this spirit, believes Amogelang. “Art is a language, a universal form of expression,” he says. “When students who are sitting in the courtyard underneath this wonderful mural, and they then read the plaque detailing its inspiration, they find new meaning in it and derive their own meaning from it.” Commissioning Thobile Mavuso proved the perfect fit: she is young, female, vibrant, upcoming, locally-based in Joburg, multidisciplinary – she works in paint, photography, text, sound, and printmaking – and a student too, with her own complicated history. Born and bred in the city, she has long wrestled with her Ndebele culture. She started writing poetry in earnest at the age of 11 to process her emotions around troubles at home, culminating in the publication of her award-wining anthology Songs Broken Women Sing in 2019. “This latest artwork calls for its viewers to remember who they are no matter how far away they may feel or be from their ancestral lands and events,” she says. “Their work is to celebrate their culture, and to keep it alive. Culture, like art, is a living thing.”</description>

      <title>Judging Africa’s emerging talent by Mary Corrigall</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/judging-africa-s-emerging-talent-by-mary-corrigall</link>
      <description>Judging Africa’s emerging talent On 2 March 2022, Latitudes and ANNA launch the ANNA Award, an annual contemporary art prize for women-identifying artists from South Africa. In the lead up, arts researcher Mary Corrigall surveys the landscape, examining a host of awards that are geared towards identifying Africa’s next art superstar. ----------------- Michaela Younge at her booth at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair, where she was awarded the Tomorrow/Today&apos;s Award. Image credits: Stephanie Veldman There is a dizzying amount of art being produced on the African continent. No one has undertaken a study to establish how much new art is being made on a monthly or yearly basis, probably since it would be akin to chasing butterflies and pinning them down. This fact, can be source of great anxiety for some art collectors. Given there is so much art out there, and often collectors wish to buy art from artists in countries other than their own, yet know little of the artistic or social histories that shape art there, how do you sort between the wheat and the chaff? External or institutional validation of an artist&apos;s practice can help distinguish artists from each other. For established artists, their exhibition history and auction records provide some insight into their standing, commitment to their practice and consensus around the value of their art, but for emerging artists who have yet to rack up a list of exhibitions, it can be trickier to judge whether they are serious and worth supporting. An installation view of the finalists of the Norval-Sovereign Art Prize, which were on exhibit at the eponymous art foundation in Cape Town. Image credits: Mike Hall This is the role awards can play, particularly in a nascent art market where many of them are geared towards identifying, rewarding and further developing emerging talent. As such these awards give such a boost to the artist in terms of their confidence and exposure that in and of itself, the artists who receive them are more likely to succeed due to the recognition. Many of the awards for artists are South African based, however, some evince a pan-African outlook, inviting nominations or entries from other African countries. This includes the newly established Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, which was awarded to a South African artist, Banolo Kavula, however, it included among others a short-list of artists such as Cassi Namoda, the US-based Mozambican artist, Dawit L. Petros from Eritrea, Mohssin Harraki from Morocco and Abraham Onoriode Oghobase from Nigeria. Unexpectedly, the Public Vote Prize went to Rene Travares who lives between Sao Tomé and Lisbon. Many years ago the the Absa L’atelier Award shifted its focus, directly inviting artists from outside South Africa to submit entries to the award, focussing on residents of Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, the Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. However, last year a South African, Abongile Sidzumo, took the main prize, The Gerard Sekoto Award. A South African, Phoka Nyokong, took the award the previous year too, as did the previous one. It is probably hard to beat South African artists on their home-ground, but also because the South African art market is the most developed on the continent. This is connected to high-quality art schools and graduates who exhibit a sophisticated awareness of the kind of art that resonates with trends in contemporary practice. As such often the artists from other African countries who attract these South African awards are based in this country or have studied here. Last year’s winner of the 2021 Cassirer Welz Award bucked this trend. Artist Samuel Nnorom is Nigerian born and educated. Will Nnorom go on to be an African art superstar? Realistically, there are so few superstars, and none of these awards, no matter how well adjudicated or unbiased, can reliably be predictors of this status. At best, they can offer a clue. Take Blessing Ngobeni, who won this award in 2012. It was the succession of other events in his artistic trajectory that hinted at his bright future. Finding suitable candidates is probably one of the biggest challenges for the organisers of these awards; open calls might result in a glut of unsuitable entries. Identifying judges with a broad knowledge of and contact with emerging artists across the African continent is tricky too, given the territory is so massive and very few specialists have an inside track into every art capital. In an attempt to circumvent these pitfalls, the organisers of the Norval-Sovereign award relied on a board comprising of as many as 53 independent arts professionals – “comprising curators and academics who work closely with artists in their respective regions, (who) nominated 158 artists for the Prize.” From there, 30 finalists were shortlisted by a group of respected art professionals from different countries – mostly outside of the African continent. The result was such a varied list of artists at different stages of their careers it was almost impossible to consider how they could validly be judged against each other. Could anyone claim that Kimathi Mafafo’s embroidered figurative works could be compared to one of Esther Mahlangu’s precise Ndebele paintings? As such, while a democratic approach is best, when too many people are involved there may be less focus and consistency. In the end it wasn’t surprising that a hot young artist with a novel vocabulary won the award – jurists will inevitably wish for an award to capture what is considered to be ‘new, now’. Work by the Absa L’Atelier Group B 2021 winner, Ayobola Kekere-Ekun Art fair awards tend to sway between the two poles – recognising rising and then established talent. The Tomorrow/Today’s award title that goes to an emerging artist in this titular section of the fair at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair states the artist’s status. Last week Michaela Young took the award. She has enjoyed several gallery exhibitions and her aesthetic is well-known - as such the recognition seems belated. However, for those collectors who may have been on the fence with regards to acquiring her work this could give them the confidence to take home one of her homely looking felt tableaux creations. The other nominees also naturally share some of the spotlight, particularly given the structure of this award, where each nominee enjoys a solo booth in a prominent position at this annual art fair. The Art X Lagos art fair award singles out an emerging artist but also, much like the Absa L’Atelier award, appears to offer the recipient a chance to be part of a residency outside of their native country. Chigozie Obi, last year’s winner, received a grant towards making work for a solo presentation at ART X Lagos fair but also secured a three-month residency at Gasworks, London. Further, mentorship and support is offered. In this way this award is focussed not only on marking out new talent but identifying one that should be nurtured further. Awards might assist collectors in identifying artists to collect early on in their careers but as they are often philanthropic activities, allowing the sponsors to be seen as ‘giving back&apos; or lending support at a grassroots level, the outcome should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. The judges experience should be scrutinised closely too. The prize attached to the FNB Art Joburg (formerly Joburg Art Fair) has gone through phases of recognising artists who are already on the global art map, such as Billie Zangewa, Bronwyn Katz and Peju Alatise to those that are on the cusp of being acclaimed such as Turiya Magadlela or Haroon Gunn Salie. Few probably recall that Portia Zvavahera, who now is represented by and stages shows at the world-famous David Zwirner gallery, was the recipient of this award in 2014. At the time she won it her work was affordable and within reach. Pre-Covid the recipients of this award would have a solo booth at the fair as well as receive a cash prize. In this way, they benefitted from sales of their works, which were naturally boosted due to the recognition. Norval Foundation and The Sovereign Art Foundation (SAF) declared artist, Bonolo Kavula as the winner of The Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, 2022 The sale of nominees works for awards appears to be a common characteristic of them and more recently this aspect has manifested in the finalists works being auctioned online. This proved a particularly popular trend during Covid-19 when the physical exhibition of works may have been limited or had limited visitors. The RMB Talent Unlocked Programme, The Emerging Painting Invitational (EPI), The Blessing Ngobeni Art Prize, The Cassirer Welz Award and the Norval Sovereign Award all conclude with the finalists works being auctioned. This may be one way for auction houses to support talent at a grassroots level, allow the artists to generate an income from their entries, and raise their profile among the collectors who trawl through these auctions looking for low value works that may rise in value at a later stage. However, it may also be too early for some of the artists to have their works sold in the secondary market, which is usually reserved for proven artists. Given this, the sell-through rates are not particularly high. Securing secondary market sale records early on in an artist&apos;s career can be a boost, however, conversely not selling any works could prove to put a damper on future sales. Bonolo Kavula as the winner of The Norval Sovereign African Art Prize, 2022 “The rigid separation between primary and secondary markets and the dangers to reputation of artists formerly through participation in auctions simply do not apply any more. Hybrid is the name of the present moment especially in the context of Africa where Eurocentric legacy structures are not particularly relevant. Our first auction in 2020 was a remarkable success giving much needed income to young artists and creating fantastic new opportunities through visibility like gallery representation exhibition projects entry into major collections,” said Valerie Kabov, founder of the EPI award. The pricing and bidding transparency that these online auctions for award finalists entails certainly gives collectors and dealers insight into which artists the ‘market’ responds to most, generating perhaps another round of ‘judgement’ marking out another set of winners and losers. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based art advisor, journalist and researcher. - Latitudes and ANNA are set to launch the ANNA Award on 2 March.

      <title>RMB Latitudes Art Fair Captures Joburg’s Creative Spirit</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/articles/rmb-latitudes-art-fair-captures-joburg-s-creative-spirit</link>
      <description>RMB LATITUDES ART FAIR CAPTURES JOBURG&apos;S CREATIVE SPIRIT - By Mary Corrigall Southern Guild booth, RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy Due to the rambling layout of Shepstone Gardens with various buildings, some of which serve no apparent purpose other than to stand as monuments to ancient architecture and mythical stories, there is always a hidden surprise waiting to be discovered at every edition of the RMB Latitudes Art Fair. A double-volume almost free-standing tower to the right of the Latitudes Centre of the Arts is where you expect to encounter something unconventional, un-art fair-like. It is a challenging space to present art so it lends itself to an unconventional installation. Last year, it was home to architect Kate Otten&apos;s Threads, an installation that debuted at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. RMB Latitudes Art Fair Gardens 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy With associations to royalty this year it proved a fitting location for Mary Sibande&apos;s &quot;A Queen Never Dies&quot; a new sculptural installation work, featuring her seminal character Sophie suspended in the tower. As is always the case she is adorned in a grand outfit that propels her to greater heights, imagined spaces. This time it was created by a queen in the fashion realm, Palesa Mokubong, known for her bold silhouettes and distinctive textile patterns. The title was apt; royal figures live on in effigies intended to immortalise them, and their place in history, and their status can never be refuted or undone. In a way, the same can be said of Sibande, who via the figure evoking her grandmother will also remain a celebrated figure of the SA art world. The fact that her latest Sophie work occupied the most coveted space for grand artistic statements at this art fair surely proves this idea. It could also be argued that the RMB Latitudes Art Fair, which celebrates art, creativity, and, in the case of Sibande and Mokubong, the blending of design and art businesses, advancing relationships between designers and artists, also makes a case for Joburg as the indefatigable &apos;Queen&apos;. Mary Sibande&apos;s &apos;A Queen Never Dies&apos;, RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy Whatever bad press this city battles, events such as this serve as a reminder that this city is bursting with art, creativity and innovation. The RMB Latitudes Art Fair, located just streets away from some of Joburg’s most glaring examples of urban decay, serves as a bold reminder that life continues and even flourishes, despite challenges. The satisfying mix of art, design, fashion, and wine all consumed in a seemingly bucolic setting over five days restores this notion. The fact that tickets sold out days, perhaps even a week, before the grand iron gates opened to this annual art fair suggests that Johannesburg residents are eager to immerse themselves in the visual delights available. Many are willing to take an Uber or be dropped off in a Lexus provided by the park-and-ride service. People queue up for this journey of discovery past the gurgling water features and along the overgrown stone paths that link all the art and creativity on display at this event. As with the city’s most famous artist, William Kentridge, many local artists&apos; connection to the city spills into their art. The most obvious example was the work of Terence Maluleke at Southern Guild, whose booth occupied the prime spot of the Latitudes Art Centre. The Joburg skyline formed the backdrop for paintings inflected with warm tones of yellow orange and even green, in work showing a subject revelling in one of the city&apos;s best parks - Emmarentia. However, it was a large painting of Hadedas on plastic yellow garden chairs that was the most evocative nod to the artist&apos;s hometown. This is the first time Southern Guild has participated in this art fair. Terence Maluleke, HAAAA!, 2025, presented by Southern Guild For Cape Town-based galleries this art fair presents either the opportunity to showcase Cape Town-based artists making waves in their city to Joburgers or to connect and forge relationships with artists from Joburg. Although the Cape Town art ecosystem has grown rapidly, most artists in South Africa are located in Joburg. For those who have chosen to semi-grate, Joburg still has a hold on them. Take Guy Simpson, whose childhood home near Shepstone Gardens, formed the inspiration for a solo presentation, titled Running Parallel, with Untitled Art, which fetched the Lexus Best Stand Award. Given the banality of the subject matter - peeling walls, nails, blinds and skirting boards - this may have been unexpected, however, collectively, the paintings on this stand and how they were hung made for a compelling visual journey. Nostalgia runs so deep and keeps so many spiritually connected to Joburg regardless of the urban decay that chips at its facade. Untitled&apos;s Booth featuring Guy Simpson&apos;s solo presentation &apos;Running Parallel&apos; at RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy Despite having a Joburg gallery Stevenson also made their first appearance with a modest but well-considered booth. They presented a mix of well-known names such as Serge Alain Nitegeka to more ‘affordable’ works by younger artists, such as a series of small portraits by Lebogang Mogul Mabusela, whose work was initially offered on the Latitudes Online portal a few years ago. The well-publicised drop in value at auction for so-called black portraiture as reported in a contentious feature in the New York Magazine, doesn&apos;t hold water at this art fair. This &apos;genre&apos; remains robust locally. This is for the simple fact that this &apos;market&apos; is not intended to feed American, European or Asian speculative art buyers but addresses a fundamental drive for African artists to depict themselves and their communities and appeal to new art collectors. As such portraits by Kamohelo Blessing Rooi flew off the walls of EBONY/CURATED&apos;s booth. Indeed they were highly desirable, particularly the larger-scaled works that were hung on Saturday with subjects resplendent in outfits by Wanda Lephoto. This was another satisfying art and fashion collaboration at this fair. At the grassroots level - best explored at the Manor House, at the RMB Talent Unlocked and Asisibenze Art Atelier booths - the compulsion to paint portraits of black subjects remains essential for artists, even as a starting point. It is not a racially exclusive pursuit if you consider how quickly Kevin Collins &apos;pottery portraits&apos; of quirky white caricatures found buyers. Kevin Collins booth surrounded by guests, photo by Anthea Pokroy It is perhaps a stretch to classify the paintings at the BKhz booth by Thando Salman as portraits. For some time this gallery, founded by artist Banele Khoza, championed artists who embraced this traditional genre. Salman pushed the boat out so to speak in the works for the fair, in a curious series of paintings of male subjects in onesies embarking on a secret journey in nature. Were they in search of their manhood? Certainly, those who refused to submit - notably a man dressed in a suit - came to a bitter end. It brought male initiation ceremonies to mind. Nostalgia and familiarity perhaps compelled many to Strauss &amp; Co&apos;s booth on the mezzanine level at the Latitudes Centre for the Arts to spy another art queen - the &apos;Lady from the Orient’ (1955) by Vladimir Tretchikoff. Whatever your feelings may be for this kind of &apos;orientalism kitsch&apos; curiosity will get the better of you. It may well have been the most expensive work on display at this fair with a price tag of up to R7 million, though when the bidding took off on Tuesday, 27 May, it fetched an astonishing R31-million (including buyers premiums). Lady from the Orient’ (1955) by Vladimir Tretchikoff, at RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy More tightly curated displays of historical works that stood out at this year&apos;s fair were from the former auctioneer Ruarc Peffers of Peffers Fine Art with his interest in art history channelled through two booths which were both rewarding for visitors. In collaboration with curator and founder of RMB Latitudes Art Fair, Lucy MacGarry, a clear visual conversation was established between special drawings by sculptor Sydney Kumalo and sculptures by Amalie Von Maltitz, a talented South African female sculptor who has been overlooked despite her obvious skill. Von Malitz should be a familiar name to us all. RMB Latitudes’ Special Project, ESSAY, focusing on the drawings and sculptures of two prolific South African artists, Sydney Kumalo and Amalie von Maltitz In the Centre Court Peffers Fine Art presented archival photographs by some seminal photographers - Alf Kumalo to Ernest Cole - images of musicians from the 1950s. These moody black and white images captured the vitality and energy of the likes of Hugh Masekela to Dolly Rathebe while performing. A very young Masekela jumping in the air stood out as did one of Gideon Nxumalo leaning into a piano tinkling on a few keys with his eyes closed. This image encapsulated an artist lost in his art. Peffers Fine Art Booth, RMB Latitudes 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy With art dotted in every nook and cranny of the sprawling Shepstone Gardens during this fair, visitors could easily get lost in discovering art. Importantly, the 1950s photographic archive brought to mind another era in Joburg, a heyday of creativity in art, music and fashion that also allowed its denizens to rise above the miasma of bad politics that threatened the spirit of this city&apos;s creative community. 28 May 2025 .m-article__header, .m-article__feature-image { display: none !important; }</description>

      <title>Imaginal Renderings: ‘Seeing the Invisible’ in Kirstenbosch Gardens</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/imaginal-renderings-seeing-the-invisible-in-kirstenbosch-gardens</link>
      <description>Imaginal Renderings: ‘Seeing the Invisible’ in Kirstenbosch Gardens A review by Lukho Witbooi on the 1st of March 2022 for ArtThrob . ---------------------- Mohammed Kazem, Directions (Zero), 2021 I suspect I spend an average of 24 hours on YouTube a week. It makes me feel like I am plugged into an information matrix, and I can’t tell where my thoughts begin or end. It’s shortly after watching Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse announcement that I go to Kirstenbosch Gardens to see an augmented reality contemporary art exhibition called Seeing The Invisible. The exhibition features 13 augmented reality (AR) works by 12 established artists from various countries and is co-curated by Hadas Maor (curator of contemporary art) and Tal Michael Haring (virtual and augmented reality expert and curator). The duality of Seeing The Invisible IN the Kirstenbosch Gardens creates a sense of having stepped into an architectural rendering. El Anatsui, AG + BA (AR) 2014, 2021 Mohammed Kazem’s Directions (Zero) is a big golden zero that looks like it’s growing from the ground. It looks both real and unreal. It’s like I caught up to a golden rainbow with geographical coordinates of the world’s countries inscribed on its surface. You can go under Directions (Zero) and see its three-dimensional structure, but as your body passes through it, a sense of alienness sticks with you, like the moon has come down to earth in its perceived size or you’ve come across the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey. In Directions (Zero), Kazem explores the significance of the number zero – discovered by the Persian scientist Muhammad Ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi. The artwork is about the origins and connections of all things. Zero is used as a placeholder which connects all humans, as it does for numbers, despite their complexity. By including all the geographical coordinates of all the countries in the world, the artist asks us to acknowledge differences, but also to think about peaceful co-existence. Ori Gersht, Forget Me Not, 2021 Ori Gersht’s Forget Me Not is based on Brueghel the Elder’s painting Flowers in a Wooden Vessel (1606/7). It is a bouquet of white, red and yellow roses with sunflowers inside a grey base. You come across the artwork in the middle of a stone trail of the Kirstenbosch Gardens, and it’s accompanied by the humming of bees which creates this foreboding feeling. It’s beautiful and awful. Are these flowers for a wedding or a funeral? As you step closer to the artwork, it explodes, sending fragments of smoke, glass, petals, and insects into the air in slow motion like bullets from The Matrix. You can then observe all the details: a beetle in the air or a white flower petal. Take time to appreciate an artwork that links both chaos and order. The symbolism of life and death. The artwork leaves an imaginal impression as I reflect on it later; the phone used to see the invisible has been discarded by the imagination, but the visual impression I experienced remains. The voices of three scholars are also heard: “Scribing the once lush bouquet from a personal point of view, they offer different interpretations of the original painting that disappeared in the folds of time.” El Anatsui’s iconic bottle-cap installations AG + BA (AR) use the same material, but they create two different installations and experiences. The first artwork is like a red tent on the ground. It’s a beautiful red with bits of yellow. On closer inspection, you can see the bottlecaps sewn together, and the craftsmanship is obvious. So are the folds of its bent shape that are detailed enough to include shadows. There is also a slight breeze, making the artwork move. The craftmanship brings attention to the material used. Anatsui uses thousands of aluminium bottle-tops wired together with copper to make useful and beautiful discarded materials. The other artwork is a silver hanging ball on a blue string. Because it is an AR work, it hangs from the clear sky. It’s like the artist made this artwork and placed it in a fire and removed it as it started shrinking. The piece has holes in it and looks like a bird’s nest or a futuristic treehouse. El Anatsui’s installations impress the most upon the imagination. Is it because these are acute representations of existing artworks? Yes, what I’ve seen are immaterial objects through a phone, but the detailed craftsmanship and the texture of these works evokes sensations of plastic on the tongue or crushing plastic bags with my hands. It’s clear that in appreciating Seeing The Invisible the visual and audible are not enough and that memories of what we’ve experienced with all our five senses remain potent. This realisation grounds me back to the material. I decide I am going to make time for the aromatic plants of the Kirstenbosch Gardens. Seeing the Invisible is on show at Kirstenbosch Gardens until August 2022.</description>

      <title>Central and West African artists are penetrating the South African Art Market</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/central-and-west-african-artists-are-penetrating-the-south-african-art-market</link>
      <description>Valued Central and West African artists are penetrating the South African Art Market Up until recently the secondary market for works by artists from Central and West Africa has largely been established in France and the UK. Aspire Art&apos;s March sale could be turning the tide. ---------------------- Paul Kodjo, Extrait du roman photo &quot;Perdue et retrouvée&quot;, 1973, Presented by Aspire Art Artists from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other central African countries, such as Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, have been a part of curatorial conversations surrounding contemporary African art in Europe since the mid-noughties, when they started gaining traction in museums. Due to the colonial ties with France and Belgium and a shared language, more narrow, regionally focussed exhibitions establishing contemporary artists from those regions took place in those European countries. Among others, such exhibitions included, Popular Painting (curated by Bambi Ceuppens and Sammy Baloji) at the Bozar for popular Fine Arts in Brussels, and the Beauté Congo 1926-2015 Congo Kitoko curated by Andre Magin for the Foundation Cartier in Paris , while Popular Painting From Kinshasa , showed at the Tate Modern. This established a market for artists included in those shows and quickly translated into them featuring on auctions offering African art in London and Paris. As a result, high-profile European collections dedicated to art from the African continent almost always include works by those first-generation contemporary artists from the Congo or Ivory Coast who came to define this &apos;category&apos;. Yet, in South Africa, exposure to art from the DRC and other central and West African countries has been limited. Zemba Luzamba, &lt; Swag &gt;, Presented by Aspire Art Few works by artists from these regions have been shown at exhibitions in South Africa. As such, collectors are paying attention to the upcoming Aspire Art&apos;s sale taking place in Cape Town on March 16, as it includes many works by celebrated artists from central and west Africa, with largely proven auction records. With works by older generation artists - Frédéric Bruly Bouabré (Ivory Coast), Pilipili Mulongoy (Congo), Roger Botembe Mimbayi (DRC) and Chéri Cherin, to a younger set including Joseph Eze, William Chechet (both from Nigeria), Arim Andrew (Uganda) and Zemba Luzamba (DRC). Williams Chechet, Kaboom II, Presented by Aspire Art This central, west African flavour to the auction is no doubt a product of this auction house’s relationship with prestigious French auction houses, where the above-mentioned artists&apos; works are an almost permanent fixture on African art sales. In a sale conducted by Artcurial in March last year, every work by Mulongoy sold and all, but one, fetched sums that far exceeded the high-estimates set for them. In the Forest (1995), a characteristic work by Mulongoy, presenting an idyllic natural scene, offered at the Aspire Art sale is priced at a modest R80 000. Joseph Eze, Tribal Blue Vuitton, Presented by Aspire Art While works by Luzamba have typically excelled on African-focussed sales in France, last year in October, Luzamba’s Social Report (2018) fetched more than R300 000 at an auction conducted by Christie’s in London. Notably, this record wasn’t set at an African focussed auction, but one boasting works by desirable contemporary artists from around the world, proving that Congolese art is no longer limited to collectors with an African focus. Swag (2019), which features two dapper men – a common motif in Luzamba’s art - is on offer at the Aspire Art for R100 000. It is typical for the Congolese painter to present his subjects detached from a context. The Ivorian photographer, Paul Kodjo, also offers a compelling stylised image of a man with swagger in one of the images contained in an archival collection offered at this auction. He appears powerful, despite being seated, and a female subject towers over him. The series plots out a fictional photo story steeped in seventies aesthetics. The artists from these different central and west African countries are influenced by specific regional conditions, aesthetics, and movements. However, it would be easy to make a case for the enduring influence of the ‘popular painters’ from the DRC on the sort of pop-figurative art produced by the likes of Eze, Andrew, Luzamba and countless others. A collection of African art could be deemed incomplete if it doesn’t include works by Chéri Cherin, Chéri Samba or others from the so-called ‘popular painters’ movement that took hold in central Africa from the late ‘70s. The allegorical, socio-political figurative painting that characterises this movement, has come to represent a view of contemporary art from central and west Africa and is included in French-owned collections by Jean Pigozzi and The Leridon collection. Roger Botembe Mimbayi, Dialogue, Presented by Aspire Art Interestingly, it is more recent works by these artists that have been commanding high prices at auction. A 2017 work, La Plus Belle Femme Afrique, (The Most Beautiful Women are African ) fetched £22 000 (R440 000) at Bonhams, London in 2019. In line with contemporary works produced by ‘popular painters,’ the work by Cherin (Joseph Kinkonda) offered on this auction, titled La liberation de la Conscience Creatrice Emprisonnee (The release of the imprisoned creative consciousness ) features a maternal figure. Where once this would symbolise the consciousness of a nation for Cherin, this leitmotif now represents the creative mind, which is clearly hungry for inspiration. Nigerian artists such as Eze or Uganda’s Andrew, embrace the use of symbolism in their own ‘popular painting’ style, though both, as per the current portraiture trend, focus on a single subject. The bright palette rendered in flat colours continues the Congolese style yet it is markers of wealth that define the subjects – a Louis Vuitton scarf in Eze’s Tribal Blue Vuitton (2016) and a bottle of expensive champagne in Andrew’s Belaire here, Belaire there (2018). Arim Andrew, Belaire Here, Belaire There, Presented by Aspire Art The opportunity to make connections between this older generation of artists from the DRC with a younger set coming out of Nigeria and Uganda, where the portraiture trend is at its peak, and South African artworks can be done in person in Cape Town at Aspire Art&apos;s premises from March 8 to 16. - Latitudes Staff writer Aspire Art&apos;s Modern and Contemporary Art auction will take place on Wednesday 16 March 2022 at 19:00 in Cape Town REGISTER TO BID HERE View our highlights from Aspire Art&apos;s upcoming auction</description>

      <description>Art Meets: An app connecting artists, cultural professionals and audiences in Africa -------------- “With ‘Art Meets’, technology becomes a force for positive social impact, spreading culture widely in the region and contributing to a more favorable environment for artistic exploration and growth.” - Jury, Ars Electronica x CultTech Social Impact Award, 2023 The Art Meets app connects artists, cultural professionals and audiences in Africa, through a digital ecosystem for local and supranational networking. The Art Meets collective, active in South Africa’s cultural scene since 2013, has launched a new digital platform to bring artists, curators, audiences, and art spaces closer together. Known for their creative projects—from site-specific exhibitions to documentaries and podcasts—Art Meets is now expanding their work with the innovative Art Meets mobile application, cultivating networks that promote growth and development within art spaces. You can find details of the RMB Latitudes Talks Programme on the Art Meets app, now available for download on Google Play and Apple iStore . Led by cofounders Michaela Limberis, Precious Mhone and Tammy Langtry, Art Meets were the recipients of the 2020 Prince Claus Mobility Fund in partnership with The British Council. The grant supported Art Meets’ further research for the mobile app through a series of online gatherings bringing together more than 50 artists and cultural professionals from across the continent. Lerato Motshwarakgole (Ora Loapi, Botswana), Oyindamola Fakaye (CCA Lagos), Ibrahim Mahama (SCCA, Tamale), Timothy Leibrandt (ArtThrob, South Africa), Rebecca Corey (NAFASI, Tanzania) were amongst the participants. These curated sessions provided deeper insights into various local contexts and respective needs. In 2023, Art Meets received the Presidential Employment Stimulus Fund (PESP3) administered by Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), enabling the team to expand and bring their platform to life over an intensive 6-month period. Art Meets worked with project manager Thoriso Moseneke to assemble a team of talented software developers, UX/UI designers, cultural professionals and artists to work collectively on the project as a fully remote team. Later that year the Art Meets app won the Ars Electronica x CultTech Social Impact Award at the Ars Electronica Festival for Art, Technology and Society (Linz, Austria). Partnerships were formed to provide ongoing case studies in building for local projects and contexts, including a key collaboration with the African Fashion Research Institute (AFRI) on mapping their podcast series UN/FOLDING_RE/FOLDING_FOLDED: Imiphindo kwaXhosa (led by Siviwe James) in Ilali, rural Eastern Cape, foregrounding remote locations as key sites of knowledge formation. At the heart of this app is connection and collaboration. Through an interactive virtual map, users can explore art spaces, discover events, and communicate using the in-app messaging feature. Whether you&apos;re an artist looking for opportunities, a curator searching for collaborators, an aspiring collector, or someone simply passionate about African art, the app makes it easier to find and connect with people and places that matter. The long-term goal? To build a strong, sustainable network of African art communities where creatives can grow their audiences, build professional relationships, and thrive together. Art Meets is committed to making arts and culture something everyone can take part in. The Art Meets App accommodates varied levels of arts infrastructure, with the aim to override systems of economic exclusion to build local and international audiences and professional networks, beginning locally. The project is being launched in South Africa as a testing ground to further research and expand through partner locations in other regions in Africa. Project Team Credits Michaela Limberis, Precious Mhone, Tammy Langtry (cofounders): research, conceptual development, partnerships, communications Athini Bashe (lead developer), AFRI (project partner), Carlin Eloff (Lead UX/UI designer) Duduetsang Lamola (blk banaana) (graphics), Loice Mwai (development), Mandla Shonhiwa (UX/UI platform design), Micah De Jager (design intern), Melissa Griesl (social media manager), Munashe Hilton Matyatya (in-app icons), Pyda (copy), Shane Mkhize (development), Thoriso Moseneke (project manager), Bohlale Kobe (intern).</description>

      <title>The market for &apos;affordable art&apos; heats up</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/the-market-for-affordable-art-heats-up</link>
      <description>The market for &apos;affordable art&apos; heats up - By Mary Corrigall ----------- The phrase “affordable art” has a complex history within the art market. Local and international art fairs that have, at various times, attached &quot;affordable&quot; to their events have sometimes drawn the ire of art dealers and confused or alienated collectors. This is largely due to the relativity of the term “affordable”, depending on one’s geographical location or the economic strata. Art&apos;s value is also partly associated with its unattainability and its status as a symbol of wealth. That association continues to hold relevance, however in reality, artworks at various price points offered by galleries at different levels are the norm, making art accessible to a range of budgets. The Corrigall &amp; Co South Africa Patterns &amp; Pricing (2018) found that prices for art that year ranged from R650 to R7.8 million. Global conditions however, are shattering some of the stigma attached to affordable art. Economic uncertainty, high inflation, and the reported decline of the global art market are reportedly driving growth and interest in lower-valued art. South African art is competitively priced, and art dealers and artists with access to international markets are well placed to benefit from this shift. Locally, there is also a growing demand for more “affordable” art, which is increasing the number of art buyers, though it may be challenging for more established artists who rely on local sales. There is always a positive side to a market downturn. The global art market remains healthy, with an estimated value of $57.5 billion in 2024, according to the Art Basel UBS Art Market Report 2025, produced by Art Economics. However, the report found that art sales at auctions and by art dealers in the global art market fell by 12% in 2024. If you dig into these figures more closely, you discover that the major losses occurred at the top end of the art market, which has &quot;thinned out significantly,&quot; according to its author, Claire McAndrew. High net worth individuals are not in a rush to consign high-value artworks at auction in a market deemed to be in decline. Nor are they feeling bullish about acquiring expensive contemporary works that may not yield a healthy return at auction, if they choose to resell them. In line with this, one of the main findings in the Art Basel UBS Art Market Report 2025 is the growth in the lower end of the art market. This can be detected in the increase in sales of work below $50 000. In the American context, this could be deemed “affordable art”, although it translates to R900 000 in Rand terms. Smaller dealers worldwide, with a turnover of less than $250,000, (only 1% of responders to the Basel/UBS report are from the African continent) are benefiting from the demand for more “affordable” art, and have experienced a 17% increase in sales. This shift in the market was most noticeable at auctions where results and price transparency are made public and can be easily quantified and analysed. Arteconomics found that in 2024 the auction market for artworks valued under $5,000 experienced a 7% increase in value, and a 13% increase in the number of lots sold. Demand for art set at the $50 000 mark and below is not a new trend, however, it has been increasing since 2022 when &quot;the share of transactions for prices of below $50,000 was reported as 73% and this rose substantially by 13% in 2023, stabilising at 85% in 2024.&quot; The majority of the works that sold for under that amount were considerably less - $5000 &quot;even though they made up only 4% of sales values.” In local rand terms, this equates to works priced from R90 000 and less. This has naturally made South African art more attractive to foreign buyers, as for that sum, you can secure a good quality painting by an established artist. Emma Van der Merwe, director at Everard Read/Circa galleries (a participant in the RMB Latitudes Art Fair) recalls an American collector who acquired ten sculptures for their sculpture garden. The collector remarked that this was equivalent to the price of one sculpture by a renowned American artist. In line with this, some internationally established South African artists continue to sell well and do not feel pressured to create “more affordable” works, whether smaller or in other mediums. &quot;I am not considering sales and what might be more ‘saleable’ with regards to my practice. No need to. Big works sell,&quot; said painter Kate Gottgens. To meet the demand from French institutions, Barabara Wildenboer has been generating large-scale works at prices higher than what would be palatable locally, she says. &quot;I recently had a solo exhibition locally where the works were smaller, at lower prices, and I didn&apos;t do as well as I would have with more expensive works,&quot; added Wildenboer. Frances Goodman&apos;s sequin “paintings”, which are considered expensive by local standards, continue to attract buyers. She suggests that tailoring works to make art that is less expensive isn&apos;t always a successful endeavour. Frances Goodman, Red Horizon, 2023, Hand Stitched Sequins on Canvas, 136 x 184,5 x 7cm, image courtesy of the artist &quot;When I’ve made cheaper or edition pieces with the idea of making my work more affordable and readily available, it hasn&apos;t necessarily landed that way. People are not interested in buying pieces that are smaller or affordable just for the sake of it,&quot; she adds. Turiya Magadlela is known for her large-scale textile works made from pantyhose and has an established international market. Yet, she has experienced a lull in the demand for her works. To counter this, she began offering works on paper. &quot;I’ve been selling pages from my A3 sketchbook, they’re moving slowly. My large works, even the ones that some institutions have promised to buy, remain unsold. I want to be positive, but it’s hard,&quot; says Magadlela. Turiya Magadlela, Tembeka Akukhontombi engiyithandayo II, R1,800.00 ex. VAT, Latitudes Limited Print, Archival Giclee Print on Felix Schoeller True Fibre 200gsm, BUY NOW The rise in sales of lower-valued works at auction, which was identified in the UBS/Basel report, hasn’t been noticeable locally. Strauss &amp; Co Auction house hasn’t seen a marked increase “in the sales of lower-priced works per se, but what we have observed, is a steady growth—20% over the last four years—in new collectors entering the market. These collectors tend to start more cautiously, typically with lower-priced works such as a work on paper, and gradually move towards higher-value acquisitions as their confidence grows,” says Bina Genovese, director at Strauss. In an effort to cater to new collectors, Strauss &amp; Co has been offering monthly online art auction, providing “an accessible entry point, offering a wide range of works across price bands and mediums, which continues to support this growth in early-stage collecting,” says Genovese. Some South African gallerists are experiencing a demand for lower-priced art. Van der Merwe affirms this shift in the market, yet she is mindful that the notion of &quot;affordable artwork” is constantly changing. WORLDART gallery, a smaller gallery in Cape Town participating in the upcoming RMB Latitudes Art Fair, has also noticed an increase in the demand for lower-priced works. To cater to this, founder and director, Charl Bezuidenhout, typically presents a range of works at various price points in his exhibitions and art fair presentations. Tafadzwa Masudi, Tandavara serunyemba, 2025 presented by WORLDART, R68,000.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE Joburg-based Karin Preller, an independent artist who will present a booth of her work at the RMB Latitudes art fair, hasn&apos;t set out to produce more affordable works. However, she has received &quot;numerous requests from buyers for smaller or more affordable works,&quot; she says. Andrew Kayser, an established independent artist based in Joburg, has found it challenging to secure beneficial gallery representation. This may have hampered sales of his large-scale paintings (sometimes up to 1,40-metres long), and he is contemplating reducing the size of his canvases to make his work more accessible. &quot;Artists, galleries, and platforms are becoming more intentional about price accessibility. There’s a growing understanding that cultivating a future market means engaging collectors early—and that means offering work at entry-level price points,&quot; observes Sara Hallatt, founder of Africa Collect, a new enterprise that finances art purchases for under R50 000. &quot;Africa Collect was born from a deep recognition that while the contemporary art market in Africa is growing, it still largely excludes a broad base of potential collectors—particularly younger and middle-class buyers,&quot; says Hallatt. Has this demand for lower-valued works resulted in galleries and collectors favouring emerging artists over bigger, more established names, driving a shift in exhibition and art fair programmes? Everard Read mostly represents mid-career and established artists, but they have always tried to include emerging artists. &quot;You want to give young artists an opportunity and a platform to create an entry-level market space that caters to both new collectors and established collectors, local and international,&quot; observes Van der Merwe. With this in mind, the Cape Town gallery stages the “cubicle” series, providing an opportunity for a group of emerging artists (of varying ages and stages) to showcase their work in this respected gallery for two weeks. Andrew Kayser, 54 1st Street, 2023, R205,000.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE The gallery makes a conscious effort to offer works by emerging artists at local and international art fairs. At the recent ExpoChicago, a US-based fair that has become important to a range of South African dealers, sales were slower than usual. In line with the Basel report, sales were more robust in the lower bracket – priced at $50 000 and under. Van der Merwe found the mood sombre, and it was the work of Warren Maroon, an emerging Cape Town-based artist, that excited buyers. Interest in emerging artists from Africa is not new. It may have less to do with economics, and more to do with the cultural diversity and compelling narratives that underpin art from our continent. The quality of art from South Africa, in relation to the prices artists demand, is attractive. Galleries and artists operating between local and international markets will have to balance two different concepts of “affordability” without compromising on artistic values. Dealer are likely going to look to support more emerging artists to meet local demand for lower valued works. This could only benefit our art ecosystem where emerging artists outnumber established names.</description>

      <title>There’s More Than Just Art at RMB Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/there-s-more-than-just-art-at-rmb-latitudes</link>
      <description>There’s More Than Just Art at RMB Latitudes RMB Latitudes Art Fair, 2023, photography by Alexander Smith Yes, RMB Latitudes is an art fair – but it’s also a celebration of lifestyle, creativity, and community. Set in the lush, terraced gardens of Shepstone Gardens this May, the fair unfolds under crisp autumn skies, offering more than just a visual feast. It’s a full-day experience that invites you to linger: to taste, sip, explore and unwind. A Culinary Playground Between gallery booths and sculptural installations, you’ll find an open-air food offering that rivals Joburg’s best weekend markets. Whether you’re craving a quick bite or a long, lazy lunch on the lawn, the fair’s food lineup has something for every palate. Start with Coalition ’s cult-favourite Neapolitan-style pizzas, known for their perfectly blistered crusts and bold flavours. Then head to Mastro for deli delights like arancini and beautifully packed picnics – ideal for sprawling out on a blanket with a glass in hand. For something fresh and zesty, Soul Souvlaki brings its much-loved Greek street food, while Il Contadino turns out some of their signature dishes made with that same rustic flair the Parktown North eatery is known for - think burgers, prego rolls and pasta dishes. And don’t skip dessert – Baglio is serving up creamy, artisanal ice cream that’ll make you feel like summer’s not quite over. Raise a Glass Of course, no Fair day is complete without a drink in hand. Sip on Aperol Spritzes, pour a glass of Haute Cabrière’s finest MCC, rehydrate with Awari mineral water or discover a new favourite from Clink, who are showcasing a selection of small-batch, artisanal South African wines. CLINK Wine Tastings Join CLINK daily at 12:30 and 16:30 for guided wine experiences at the CLINK stands. Gabrielskloof showcases its bold and experimental Project Series, including Amphora Sauvignon Blanc, Wholebunch Syrah and Madam Lucy Bubbles, crafted on extreme terrain with minimal intervention. Carinus Family Vineyards presents a Chenin-focused journey, from gateway wines to standout expressions like Rooidraai Chenin and Syrah, all rooted in five generations of winemaking tradition and unique South African soils. Creative Calm for Kids The fair isn’t just for grown-ups. This year’s Kids Area is designed as a calm, nurturing space for little ones to tap into their own creativity. Think low-key, tactile, and joyful activities – threading beaded bracelets, decorating pebbles, weaving small wool creations, or making gentle creatures from natural materials. Kids can stay as long or as short as they like, moving between activities at their own pace. The emphasis is on sustainability, co-creation, and connection to nature – echoing the fair’s broader themes and embracing the magic of outdoor, open-ended play. Designed and run by the Imbali Visual Literacy Project, a leading arts education organisation in South Africa and known for empowering young people through hands-on, culturally rooted art education. Imbali brings their signature care and thoughtfulness to every detail of this offering. Children visiting the Fair are invited to explore their creativity through a series of gentle, low-tech activities such as threading beaded necklaces and bracelets, pebble decorating with acrylic pens, weaving on cardboard bases, and crafting small creatures using natural or found materials. In a beautiful extension of this ethos, Imbali has partnered with sustainable floral artist Emely van Heesch for a special feature: an installation of ceramic portrait heads made by Imbali’s senior students, adorned with sculptural floral arrangements by Emely. These striking pieces – a blend of youthful vision, craftsmanship and nature – will be on display and available for purchase, with proceeds going toward bursaries for Imbali students. Together, these offerings highlight the value of nurturing creativity from an early age – and the power of collaboration to shape beauty with purpose. Visit the Kids Playground on the Gardens side of the property, opposite the Manor House Come for the art. Stay for the vibe. Whether you’re gallery-hopping, wine-sipping, or pebble-painting, RMB Latitudes offers a soulful, sensory-rich experience that reflects the best of Joburg’s creative energy. Come hungry, curious, and ready to soak it all in.</description>

      <title>Mary Sibande presented by USURPA and RMB Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/mary-sibande-presented-by-usurpa-and-rmb-latitudes</link>
      <description>Mary Sibande presented by USURPA and RMB Latitudes, and collaboration with Palesa Mokubung USURPA and RMB Latitudes proudly present a solo presentation by Mary Sibande: A Queen Never Dies . For those familiar with Sibande&apos;s potent iconography, particularly the indomitable Queen Sophie, prepare for an evolution. Here, the familiar figure, a powerful embodiment of strength and the reclamation of identity within the narratives of Black South African women, transcends the sculptural form. Through an intimate collaboration with the visionary digital gallery Usurpa, Sibande propels Queen Sophie into an ethereal new dimension, envisioning her within an imagined &quot;winter wonderland&quot;. Featured work by Mary Sibande Within the unique architecture of Shepstone Gardens&apos; turret, the intricate detail of Sibande&apos;s sculpture is reborn as a luminous, three-dimensional projection – a testament to the convergence of cutting-edge digital technology and profound artistic vision. Mary Sibande x Palesa Mokubung Contemporary Art Meets High End African Couture: A Remaking of an African Icon Reclaiming Rest: The Evolving Journey of Mary Sibande’s Sophie Photography credit Lungi Ngcobo Mary Sibande’s artistic journey continues to captivate audiences who encounter her work. Now, she joins creative forces with Palesa Mokubung, the visionary behind Mantsho, a fashion brand celebrated for its bold African silhouettes and unapologetic celebration of Black femininity. This powerful collaboration marks a bold new chapter in Sibande’s evolving practice. At the heart of her work stands Sophie, her iconic alter ego, a potent symbol of Black South African womanhood and generational memory. Once portrayed in Victorian maid’s attire, Sophie embodied the tensions of servitude and aspiration, reflecting the lived experiences of Sibande’s maternal lineage. Palesa Mokubung Both Sibande and Mokubung draw on heritage, memory, and identity to challenge historical narratives and reimagine the future. Sibande, through sculpture and print; Mokubung, through textiles and design. In this meeting of disciplines, their work converges around a shared mission to centre Black women’s presence, agency, and beauty. In recent works, Sibande introduces a quieter, more contemplative Sophie, one who reclines, reads fashion news, and inhabits a space of rest. Through traditional techniques like woodcut printing, Sophie is reimagined not as a figure of labor, but of leisure. This transformation speaks to a broader cultural movement: rest as resistance, particularly for Black women whose contributions have long been undervalued. Palesa Mokubung’s involvement deepens this shift. For the first time, Sophie will be dressed in a bespoke Mantsho garment, not as costume, but as couture. Mokubung’s distinct design language, rooted in African aesthetics, becomes an extension of Sophie’s evolution. Together, artist and designer reframe Sophie as a figure of sovereignty and style, sculpted, adorned, and empowered. This collaboration will debut at the RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, where Sibande will unveil a new fibreglass sculpture of Sophie, wearing Mokubung’s signature Mantsho silhouette. The result is a striking fusion of contemporary art and fashion, a sculptural embodiment of resilience, beauty, and grace. This is more than a creative partnership. It is a celebration of Black femininity, a reclamation of space, and a redefinition of what it means to rest, to dream, and to be seen. Stay tuned for exclusive behind the scenes content and the official unveiling at RMB Latitudes 2025.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/collect-now-pay-later-on-latitudes-online</link>
      <description>Collect Now, Pay Later on Latitudes Online Latitudes Online launches partnership with Africa Collect --------- That funny little M word that makes the world go round, but shouldn&apos;t be talked about too openly. In the art world of all places, it is often more of a taboo, as the mention of the m word might seem to take away from art appreciation for art appreciation itself. But what of sustainability? It is, after all, in part what allows the ecosystem to spur forward. So, let&apos;s talk about it — money. Featured artwork: Azuka Muoh, Moon Boy Latitudes has always made attempts to be an accessible art space. Part of that means making collecting as easy as possible for our collectors, and therefore making the creation of art as sustainable as possible for the artists. To realise this, we have partnered with Africa Collect, which allows our collectors to purchase artworks from R 1,000 - R 50,000 ex VAT in automated instalment payments for a period of up to 12 months. The best part? Specialist art insurer iTOO Insurance insures the artwork against damages and theft for the duration of its payment. Featured artwork: Kirsten Sims, Read my Mind Africa Collect want to revolutionise art acquisition in South Africa Africa Collect is a financial organisation with art at its heart. Founded in 2023 by Sara Hallatt and Thabo Ncalo, Africa Collect aims to support the “younger” art collector by providing finance to enable them to purchase artwork. With more than 25 years between them in the visual arts and the financial sector respectively, their hope is that this offering will not only bolster the visual arts sector (approximately a R1 billion sector in South Africa), making it more sustainable but will also enable a younger generation of art collectors to begin their collecting journey. Recognising the desire among South Africans to engage more deeply with culture, Africa Collect offers a seamless process for art enthusiasts: - Simple Enrolment: A one-time sign-up provides continuous access to a curated selection of artworks. - Flexible Payment Plans: Collectors can choose to pay over 6 or 12 months, making art ownership more accessible. - Curated Partnerships: Collaborations with pre-vetted artists and galleries ensure the highest quality and ethical standards. Currently Africa Collect has partner Galleries and Artists in both Cape Town and Johannesburg and is looking to expand. - Exclusive Discounts: Members receive a fixed 5% discount on all artwork purchases. Africa Collect&apos;s mission encompasses: - Market Access: Assisting artists and galleries in closing sales and reaching a broader audience. - Audience Development: Enhancing public knowledge and interest in visual arts through collaborative efforts. - Cultural Entrepreneurship: Supporting galleries and artists as cultural entrepreneurs through skill development initiatives. - Financial Accessibility: Providing art lovers with flexible financial options to facilitate art purchases. - Art Education: Empowering collectors through rewards programs and community engagement to deepen their appreciation and understanding of art. How it works: The buyer selects an artwork they love. They apply for a loan through the Africa Collect website. After a credit check and approval, Africa Collect pays the gallery or artist. The buyer pays a 10% deposit and takes the artwork home. They repay the balance over up to 12 months. By bridging the gap between artists and collectors, Africa Collect aims to foster a vibrant and inclusive art community in South Africa. Sara and Thabo so strongly believe in their mission that they have put their money where their mouth is and have privately funded this loan book. ABOUT THE FOUNDERS Thabo Ncalo With over two decades of experience in financial services and investment management, Thabo Ncalo has built a career at the intersection of venture capital, alternative funds, and equity investing—driving economic growth across South Africa and the continent. His expertise spans both tech-driven and social impact funds, reflecting a commitment to innovation and sustainable development in Africa’s financial ecosystem. Ncalo’s career trajectory includes pivotal roles at major financial institutions such as Investec Asset Management (now NinetyOne), STANLIB Asset Management, and Old Mutual, where he honed his investment strategies and market insights. Now, as a venture capital manager at 8th Season and Future Build, Ncalo is actively shaping the next generation of African enterprises, channeling capital into high-growth ventures poised to redefine industries. His leadership in VC underscores the increasing role of alternative investments in fuelling the continent’s economic transformation. Sara Hallatt Few individuals have shaped Johannesburg’s contemporary art landscape as profoundly as Sara Hallatt. A powerhouse in arts programming and cultural entrepreneurship, Hallatt is the founder of the META Foundation, a non-profit established in 2020 as the programming arm of August House, a renowned artist community in Doornfontein. Beyond META, she is also the force behind Contra.Joburg, the city’s largest on-the-ground visual arts festival, and Africa Collect, a pioneering loan service enabling art collectors to invest in artworks—both initiatives reinforcing her commitment to expanding access to the arts. Hallatt’s journey began in below-the-line marketing in 2003 with Blackmagic Communications after earning her BADA from Wits University. She soon transitioned into large-scale event production, working with the VWV Group on globally significant projects, including the 2009 Confederations Cup Opening &amp; Closing Ceremonies and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Her shift into the visual arts was marked by her leadership at the Bag Factory Artists’ Studios, one of South Africa’s most influential visual arts NGOs, where she served as Director from 2011. In 2020, she further cemented her role in the arts by taking over the management of August House, a vital creative hub in Johannesburg. A Mandela Washington Fellow, Hallatt studied business and entrepreneurship at Northwestern University in Chicago and holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Business Management. With her diverse expertise spanning marketing, large-scale event production, and arts development, she continues to shape Johannesburg’s creative economy—fostering sustainability, accessibility, and innovation in the visual arts sector.

      <title>The Pulse Lounge at RMB Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/the-pulse-lounge-at-rmb-latitudes</link>
      <description>The Pulse Lounge RMB Latitudes Art Fair invited acclaimed architecture and interior design studio Boogertman + Partners – one of Africa’s largest architectural firms – to design the lounge in the centre court at this year’s fair. ---------- Drawing on extensive experience in shaping the flow of people through a wide range of environments – from stadiums, retail centres and airports to more intimate interior settings – the Boogertman + Partners team has conceived a temporary pavilion that encourages interaction, connection and a deeper appreciation of the surrounding art. Titled The Pulse , the installation offers visitors and exhibitors moments of stillness, refreshment and conversation amid the vibrant energy of the fair. With its visually arresting presence and warm, earthy tones – inspired by the fair’s visual identity – the lounge establishes an eye-catching destination within the centre court. Diaphanous drapes and distinctively patterned floors – created in collaboration with Belgotex – subtly define the space without enclosing it, and offer inviting glimpses of the interior. Organic curves, flowing lines and overlapping forms generate a visual rhythm that intuitively guides and orients visitors. The interior is arranged around three softly defined pods, created in collaboration with X-Furniture, who also provided purpose-designed seating that can be reconfigured to accommodate different group sizes and types of interaction. Varying in colour, scale and lighting, each pod possesses its own unique character and atmosphere. The two outer pods prioritise standing space, embracing the energy and movement around the entrances, while the central pod offers a lower, more intimate seating area. This interplay of movement and pause is enhanced by subtle changes in lighting, material and spatial volume, creating a natural flow around and through the space. Lighting by Regent Lighting adds a layered sensory dimension, modulating the ambience within each pod. Textural details and sculptural botanical installations by Johannesburg-based floral designer Loulou D – each echoing the palette of its respective pod – further enrich the experience. Audio equipment from Bang &amp; Olufsen and scent diffusers by Frédéric Malle complete the immersive, multi-sensory environment. Custom textile designs – developed in-house by Boogertman + Partners’ graphic team in collaboration with Fabric Bank – draw on abstract elements inspired by the visual languages of the fair’s branding, its sponsor and the studio itself. This layered approach reinforces the identities of all three without detracting from the visitor experience. The textiles will be available for purchase via Fabric Bank’s online store. All elements of the lounge have been designed to be reusable.</description>

      <description>Tracing Borders and Shaping Futures: The Botswana Focus at RMB Latitudes - by Timothy Gawaya -------------- Mochudi 1966, A public meeting in the town’s central ‘square’, courtsey Sandy Grant&apos;s &apos;Botswana: Photographs of a Country in Transition Places and Their People 1965 - 2016&apos; Art Fairs are a manifestation of the productive tension between a thing and its parts, aiming to present a global whole in a serial manner. For RMB Latitudes’ Botswana exposé, operating within an ethos of accessibility, collective engagement can be conceptualised and established through a singular focus on a locale. This year’s Botswana focus grapples with the historical and ideological narratives of borders, those internal to the region as well as the geographical markers distinguishing Botswana in relation to South Africa and the broader world. From this juncture, it is perhaps possible to conceive and conceptualise critical frameworks and projects rooted in the nuances of Botswana’s cultural and political landscape. Exhibiting at RMB Latitudes this year are The Space Botswana, ReCurate, Banana Club, TBP Artist Collective, and Art Residency Centre Botswana (ARC), curated by Latitudes Curator Boitumelo Makousu. Latitudes’ focus on Botswana aims to showcase the country’s inexhaustible visual histories through a focus on contemporary artistic thought and practice. Yet this is by no means a melancholy attempt at recapitulating previous models and moments through contemporary mediation (neither should this be seen as a retrieval contending for purposive resolution which often only occurs through semblances and apparitions.) By contrast, the focus serves as an incubation space, a means of inserting Botswana’s art into the zeitgeist. This drive is reflected in a special online collaboration with Ora Loapi, a Gaborone-based curatorial and archival project founded by Lerato Motshwarakgole. As it were, a core notion informing Ora Loapi is uncovering Botswana’s complex and often obscured visual histories. Thero Makepe, The Place that Dried Up, 2023, R31,250.00 ex. VAT, presented by Vela Projects , ENQUIRE For Motshwarakgole’s work with Ora Loapi, visual archives serve a role exceeding the formation of any given identities. ‘How do we see ourselves better?’ she reflects, alluding to a project of greater complexity and value irreducible to the imposition of personalised images (such as prescriptive geographical, cultural or national boundaries.) Complexity, to a certain extent, can be understood along playful lines, interchangeable parts coming in and out of view. This invokes an image of fluidity and motion, but a motion that can’t be reduced to sequential evolution. And indeed, fluidity is a lens through which Motshwarakgole conceives the historical development of Botswana&apos;s artistic practice: from the anti-colonial cultural work of the Medu Art Ensemble in the latter half of the twentieth century to the multidisciplinary work of TBP Artist Collective in the present. Botswana’s art, broadly understood, or even the specificity of cultural work, is typified by intersecting lines and flows: a movement of ideas, techniques, and groups across social and geographic parameters. Ensembles aren’t distinct from the individuals which constitute them, and the same goes for individuals which would remain empty referents if conceived in isolation from their constitutive elements. But the three orders of magnitude – ensemble, individual, and element – don’t stand in a sequential series where one can be set against the other. Ensembles aren’t opposed to elements, in the same way that a dollop of oil paint isn’t opposed to the form imposed on the canvas. Rather, ensemble, individual, and element stand in a relation of recursive causality, an open loop where the slightest modification changes the standing of ensemble in relation to individual, individual to element, and so on: an audience member coughs and Hamlet drops poor Yorick’s skull. TBP Artist Collective, a Gaborone-based multidisciplinary contemporary artist collective, invokes an understanding of ensembles, individuals and elements for their booth at RMB Latitudes 2025. I spoke with the artist Thebe Phetogo, a member of TBP Artist Collective. “Our project [revolves] around the idea of Selemela ,” Phetogo told me. “ Selemela refers to the Pleiades star cluster, which in Setswana and other regional cultures signals the start of the ploughing season. [This] metaphor speaks to the role of TBP as a collective: we are both cultivating and archiving Botswana’s contemporary artistic voice, addressing gaps in representation within local and international art spaces.” As an ensemble, TBP’s Fair booth is a play between artists and the audience in a recursive loop, the latter conditioning the former, invoking an expansive concept of the work. This extends to the specificity of the mediums selected by the collective, ranging from painting and installation to new media. Thebe Phetogo, Lowe Day Painting (Grey Sky II), 2024, R9,800.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY A similar spread of mediums and forms is shared by The Art Residency Centre (ARC), another exhibiting space at RMB Latitudes. ARC is an artist-led initiative based in Gaborone which aims to offer a distributed platform for the dissemination of work by a new generation of Motswana artists. For their Fair booth, ARC are bringing together a diverse lineup of multidisciplinary artists. This selection of artists represents, for ARC’s co-founder Ann Gollifer, a space “[for] artworks that explore the confines of the traditional to find more relevant modes of expression.” ARC’s showcase is poised at a midpoint, a threshold marking the potential emergence of a complex visual and intellectual sensibility. The Art Residency Centre (ARC) If Botswana’s contemporary art scene is teetering between the thrill of uncertainty and creative evolution, this is reflected in ReCurate’s Fair booth. ReCurate, a leading curatorial agency in the region, aims to present a conceptual focus on the notion of transition and liminality. Meditating on Botswana’s unique racial and socio-historical constructs, ReCurate’s liminal theme is as much about temporal suspension as it is a concern with the uncertainty underpinning contingent transnational, ideological and historical structures. And yet, without diverging into the theological, purgatorial suspension is a state that is to be exceeded by necessity. For The Space Botswana, an artist hub and galley located in Maun, collaborative work and creative organisation are a means through which ambiguity and uncertainty can be overcome (as The Beatles (and the poet Dante centuries earlier) remind us, one only gets by with a little help from their friends.) The Space Botswana Exhibiting a body of work by contemporary painter Katlego Twala for RMB Latitudes 2025, Banana Club’s showcase is oriented around themes of the ephemeral and fleeting. An artist-led collective, Banana Club’s visual production and expression prioritises the formation of safe and engaging community dialogue. It might be said that the collective’s presentation of Twala’s work approaches the question of how portraiture, typically conceived as a subjective medium par excellence , exceeds the solipsistic. As opposed to descending into the interior domain of the subject, Banana Club’s showcase of Twala’s portraiture attains towards an exploration of “the fragility of personal history–the way memory distorts, fades, and yet remains deeply present.” Visule Kabunda, TA PINDA, presented by Banana Club Taken as a whole, the range of critical, archival and artistic voices emerging out of Botswana’s contemporary art scene share an ethos of premeditated divergence. However, this isn’t a complete rupture conceived along the lines of a direct split with previous modalities. Perhaps the better words are repurposing or reappropriation, not so much finding a voice as it is asserting one. Reflecting on the overall approaches of the exhibitors, Latitudes curator Boitumelo Makousu notes how the intersection of “independent interests and collective narratives not only inspires but also reveals the depth and nuances of Botswana’s arts landscape. The presentations reflect an innovative direction by the artists and curators, fostering [new methodologies that challenge barriers] around art and its historical influences.” This much is evident: Botswana’s art industry is undergoing a period of metamorphosis, in part reflected by the growing importance of collective-based experimentation and shifting critical and visual dialogue. Historically, the region’s artistic output was typified by a heritage and conservation approach, with a focus on landscape and wildlife elements. Today, despite limited support from commercial institutions, artists, thinkers and cultural archivists are refining their approaches. For Banana Club’s Tanlume Enyatseng, there’s a positive shift “towards more conceptually rigorous explorations of identity, memory, gender, and socio-political histories. Artists are engaging with family histories, oral traditions, and personal archives, using contemporary mediums to recontextualize the past. This aligns with a broader global trend of memory-based practices but remains distinctly rooted in Botswana’s own cultural frameworks.” RMB Latitudes’ Botswana Focus aims to facilitate and catalyse this critical shift, operating as a platform for the growing interest in contemporary art from the region. This will perhaps assist in increasing visibility and exposure for the visual arts in Botswana, leading to greater development and consolidation of necessary arts infrastructure. Indeed, while there are indications of outward momentum, local support is still integral for ensuring the long term sustainability of the visual arts. By highlighting independent and crucial voices, RMB Latitudes’ Botswana Focus aims to engender the future stability of visual arts in the region and beyond.</description>

      <title>The originality paradox: finding your voice in a sea of influence</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/the-originality-paradox-finding-your-voice-in-a-sea-of-influence</link>
      <description>The originality paradox: finding your voice in a sea of influence - by Timothy Gawaya -------------------- Jean-Michel Basquiat, Untitled - Pablo Picasso, 1984, oil, acrylic and oil sticks on metal, courtesy of Christie&apos;s Towards the end of last year a surge of interest in the stylistic elements of Jean-Michel Basquait’s paintings occurred in the more self-conscious corners of TikTok. The focus was largely directed towards what were perceived as ‘Basquiat clones’: young amateur painters, largely men, whose artworks were reminiscent of Basquiat’s neo-expressionism. It became a meme of sorts. On the one hand, a slew of starving young painters ‘revealed’ their artworks in a bid at achieving some semblance of recognition. However, these works were often perceived as derivative, if not outright copies, acts of desperate sacrilege outmatched by Basquiat’s authenticity. On the other hand, an increasingly hostile audience of commenters lamented the lack of artistic originality. One could be influenced by Basquiat, but how this influence is evidenced remains unclear. And even in such a case, influence is always something that must be transcended such that it does not devolve into the mechanical act of tracing lines. In the above instance, bearing too much influence impedes artistic value since the artist is perceived as rooted in the historical past. Originality, by contrast, is a means of emphasising the degree to which an artist is of their time. Contemporary art is a moment that is simultaneously historical and a-historical. It is an institution characterised by art made today. But it permits a confluence of historical styles and motifs across periods, from classical genre painting and sculpture to new media and generative artificial intelligence. This confluence adds to its ahistorical ambience, as though time were indefinitely suspended and held between two points: a prolonged yet fleeting present and an equally present, yet somehow inexistent, past. Under such conditions there is little need for contemporary artists, especially young artists, to allude to history since we find ourselves in the paradoxical moment of being in it while also above it. At the same time, this suspended moment where everything is permitted adds to a sense that there is nothing new (even though we feed on novelty). To the extent that contemporary art is saturated, absolute originality serves as a means of standing out. At such a juncture, being rooted in the historical feels like self-impairment. Picasso is believed to have once proclaimed, “Good artists copy; great artists steal.” The saying is meant to convey the sense that great art is created under the condition of direct influence, but is mutated by the artist’s purposive selection and reconfiguration of preexisting elements. Influence is something deducible after the fact, after the creative act of reworking. Elaine Sturtevant, Warhol Diptych, 1973, silkscreen inks, synthetic polymer and acrylic on canvas, courtesy of Christie&apos;s By contrast, copying is the feeble admission of one’s inability to redefine existing forms. Unlike the selective attention of great art, understood in Picasso’s terms as theft with finesse, copying is a failure because it bears too much influence. In the copy there are lingering traces of previous occupation. It is a structure that is not entirely one’s own, where the stench of previous inhabitants distorts the senses. Even after the upheavals of post-modernism and the recapitulation efforts of post-postmodernism (where are we now? post-post-postmodernism ?) originality remains a central feature of contemporary art. If we are to take the profane view and look at things from the perspective of market conditions it makes sense to think in terms of original objects. Along similar terms, the sacred view which considers art as a separate domain valorises original objects as art’s true expression. In either case, origin is emphasised over the more tedious theme of reference and citation even though they are both means through which influence is expressed. But whereas originality treats influence as obvious through indirect allusion, explicit reference is a lower game insofar as it points out its sources. Dominique Cheminais, Self Annihilation, Acrylic on Canvas, R65,000.00 ex. VAT, Presented by Kalashnikovv Gallery. ENQUIRE. Dominique Cheminais , Dora reclining, Acrylic on Canvas, R23,000.00 ex. VAT, Presented by Kalashnikovv Gallery. ENQUIRE. Indeed, for contemporary artists history (particularly art history) as a framing device might appear like an anachronism since we are both inside and outside onlookers. But this leaves us in a vacuum of exception, of anomalies paradoxically claiming both continuity and singular instantiation. Yet there is also another sense through which contemporary art grounds a sense of disjointed historical experience. Dominique Cheminais’ surrealism possesses an eerieness consistent with today’s rootlessness, yet there is a simultaneous grounding evidenced by historical allusion. In her series for Kalashnikov Gallery, A Cage in Search of a Bird , her major point of reference is Kafka whose work is widely known for its themes of alienation and indefinite postponement. Historical influence is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, but it is the work of originality which bridges the gap. If there is an unwillingness on the part of practicing artists to reference history it is because it is deemed too obvious to miss. In other words, it isn’t something spoken of as much as it is something to be recognised. If a thing is widely known it is assumed that it can remain unsaid. Dominique Cheminais, Invisible Rehearsal (Felice), Acrylic on Canvas, R65,000.00 ex. VAT, Presented by Kalashnikovv Gallery. ENQUIRE . How do we arrive at a place where art history becomes more than practiced forgetting? Events tend to unfold in a strange and ominous logic. Time’s arrow is aimed towards the sun. And perhaps the convenience of straight lines (with minor detours) outmatches the directionless nature of events. Although there is always something exceeding the concept which tends to burn with a brighter intensity. Straight lines are an exercise whereas curves are an artform, but even more gratifying are the random walks derived from their combination that stretch from here to eternity.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/reservoir-presents-here-there-and-everywhere-by-bella-knemeyer</link>
      <description>RESERVOIR presents a new a solo exhibition by Bella Knemeyer Bella Knemeyer in studio, photography credit: Jonathan Kope -------------- RESERVOIR presents Here, there and everywhere, a solo exhibition by South African artist Bella Knemeyer. The opening event took place on Thursday, 13 February 2025, and the exhibition runs until 28 March 2025. Enclosed is an excerpt of the exhibition text, The promise of repair by Hedley Twidle. At some point in the last ten years, human-made things – infrastructure, concrete, metals, asphalts, aggregates, plastics and all the rest – began to exceed the combined weight of all biomass on earth. Exactly where you place the crossover point depends: are we counting only things constructed (bridges, roads, buildings)? Or also the waste left behind after their making: mine dumps, tailings, landfill, scrapyards, piles of rubble? In 1900 (scientists estimate) human-made stuff clocked in at 3% of organic matter (everything from trees to tundra, cattle to plankton). Today human civilization weighs in at 1,1 trillion metric tonnes (the more conservative estimate). A million million tonnes, that is, pressing down on the earth’s crust, present and future. Bella Knemeyer, Pine (detail), 2025, Mulched paper with acrylic on canvas, 159.5 x 106cm, price on request, ENQUIRE In Bella Knemeyer’s work, panels of mulched paper are scored with fine striations or imbued with a delicate mesh. On shelves in her studio are pebbles of granite, dirty whitish and speckled with black grains. Or at least this is what I took them for, until I pick one up and find it unaccountably light. Also formed of papier-mâché, mixed with slate chips picked up from the railway that runs to Simonstown (where her studio is located, looking over the station, the naval dockyards and the glittering metal sheet of False Bay beyond). There are also delicate arrangements of wire with fulcrums, counterweights, like scales or seesaws; and cylinders (also paper) hanging down like those from an old pendulum clock. The combined mass of this entire body of work, I imagine, would be negligible. Even when including the small grey panels pitted with imperfections and scored with wire: portable diptychs and triptychs of concrete that remind you just how beautiful this material can be. Bella Knemeyer solo exhibition, Installation shot, courtesy of RESERVOIR ‘Materials change shape as they travel from geological deposit or forest or factory and design project to landfill’ – so writes Jane Hutton in Reciprocal Landscapes, her attempt to move back and forth between distant production site and designed landscape, to trace itineraries of the things that make up our profoundly altered world: ‘Where did they come from? What are the social and ecological conditions of their manufacture? Who made them? What is left in their place?’ The exponential growth of the built environment across the 20th and 21st centuries – an irruption of technosphere into biosphere – has happened largely within living memory (particularly following the so-called Great Acceleration post-second world war, with its large-scale adoption of concrete, crude oil derivatives and asphalt). We live within its consequences at every turn; yet somehow it is hard to believe, to imagine or take as entirely real. Bella Knemeyer, This world should be more wonderful, 2025, Mulched paper with acrylic on canvas, 130 x 100cm, price on request, ENQUIRE The unthinkable weight of this world historical process – its complex and unceasing flows of extraction, fabrication, deconstruction, beneficiation, displacement, dumping and disposal – haunts Knemeyer’s work, but in a subtle, sublimated way. The quiet delicacy of her panels and maquettes exist in an inverse or indexical relation to the flows they point to: the frenzied demolition and construction in capitalist core nations or growing urban hubs.

      <title>After Contemporary Art</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/after-contemporary-art</link>
      <description>After Contemporary Art - by Timothy Gaway a ‘BULLETPROOF’ by Beeple (Mike Winkelman). 2024. Courtesy of the artist. The days following Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential victory over Hillary Clinton can only be characterised as a headless frenzy to make sense of the incomprehensible. Clinton was the guaranteed victor by the most reliable estimates, facing someone seen as a renegade outsider. Trump was too chaotic and beyond the pale of respectable politics – hardly a statesman, he embodied the kind of doomed spectacle we’ve come to expect of politics. The New York Times forecasted Clinton as the likely candidate by a substantial margin based on pre-electoral polls, while the reputable FiveThirtyEight polling model predicted the likelihood of Trump winning at a meagre 28.6% to Clinton’s 71.4%. Something similar unfolded following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 campaign trail and subsequent endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running-mate, Tim Waltz. The Harris-Waltz platform, a relatively new player in the game, performed somewhat well despite its infancy, quickly raising a reported $1billion from donors, and a series of celebrity endorsements from the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyonce, and Charli XCX. Although beset by a number of controversies, the Harris-Waltz campaign fared better in the public eye in contrast to the weird and eerie theatrics of Trump and his VP pick, J.D. Vance. Brimming with conspiracy, the Trump-Vance campaign bumbled and dropped the ball at every turn, while major polls predicted a Harris win by a slight margin. Kamala is brat, after all. In both instances Trump was able to bypass the logic of keen observers. His 2016 victory was seen as an aberrant event, a rupture in the order of things, non-sensical to the extent that it could not be intelligibly grasped within prevailing discourse. If politics is to be understood as a legible system, then Trump appeared to evade its reasoning – or perhaps he appeared to exist outside its domain as a para-system to be accounted for and incorporated into a rational framework. ‘He Will Not Divide Us’, 2017-2021. Installation piece by LaBeouf, Turner and Rönkkö. Courtesy Luke Turner. The art world unsurprisingly offered swift responses to Trump’s initial victory, a method of quickly patching and making sense of the discontinuity inaugurated by the Trumpian era. A notable piece was by the artistic trio comprising actor Shia LaBeouf, and artists Luke Turner and Nastja Rönkkö. Titled ‘He Will Not Divide Us’, the project aimed to counter the divisive rhetoric associated with Trump and the Republican Party under the controversial, now iconic ‘Make America Great Again’ banner. The participatory performance, split across several locations, encouraged audience members to utter the phrase, ‘He Will Not Divide Us’ while being live streamed to a separate website. As a representative response from the field of contemporary art, the performance served as a “show of resistance and insistence, opposition and optimism, guided by the spirit of each individual participant and the community.” The message is clear enough: Trump, to the artists, and for contemporary art at large, represented a splitting of things as they stood. The game had not only changed, but entirely new coordinates had been introduced without prior warning. Contemporary art, already a highly politicised arena, had to contend with an occurrence that operated against the day. Moreover, the aesthetics of the Trump campaign carried a highly memetic register that rivalled the boldest excesses of modern celebrity – a feature that boosted his two wins and lent his 2020 loss to Joe Biden a rather tragic aura that ultimately fed the events of January 2021 when his supporters staged an insurrection. Contemporary art is nothing if not a theatre of critique; its value is dependent on the ability of its actors and practitioners to stage (sometimes self-annulling) appraisals of art as an institution inextricably bound to flows of capital. In its global sense, as bound to transnational capital flows, contemporary art is not only art that is made today but an ideological paradigm: art’s critical element is its selling point. If the contemporary is seen as the confluence of rational free-markets with the rhetoric of political liberalism and democratic rule, then contemporary art is the agora or public space in which this confluence is interrogated. History is neither cyclical nor a flat circle but a downward spiral. There was never any fun to be had. For many in the art world, Trump’s reelection marked a broad shift in an already fraught global political order, a confirmation that the centre had come apart. 2024 was a pivotal election year across the globe, with definitive electoral processes occurring in the United Kingdom, South Africa and India among many others. Grasped as a whole, traditional politics managed to scrape by in the face of heterodox, right-leaning populism. France’s political landscape trembled in the wake of a surging reactionary wave, where the National Rally (formerly the National Front) crossed over into the mainstream after decades of existing as a bothersome outlier. Although a coalition of left-leaning parties was able to secure a majority, edging out the National Rally by a hair, this could only be considered a minor success, an ominous refrain in the discordant symphony of an altered global order. Instagram post by artist Tracy Emin, November 2024. Screenshot by author. With a second Trump administration in sight, contemporary art is gearing to stage another four years of oppositional optimism to counter the Trumpian moment, perhaps broadly typified as a suspicion of the currents of political liberalism. Indeed, a coterie of notable and widely acclaimed figures, such as the exiled Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and British conceptual artist Tracy Emin, expressed their dismay at the results of the 2024 US presidential election. This came on top of rigorous support for Kamala Harris by high-profile artworld figures like Jeff Koonz and critic Jerry Saltz. If greater politicisation is indeed possible at this critical juncture we may witness an increased reflection on political sovereignty and autonomy in the art field. However, this must come to grips with the broad disintegration of the liberal project in many facets of existence. And if there’s anything to be gleaned from the highly publicised purchase of Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian by a crypto mogul who recently donated $18 million to a Trump-backed venture, it’s that all gloves are off: contemporary art’s sacral claims to progressivism cannot compete with the profanations of crypto-bros, our tech overlords and proto-Caesarist political candidates blitzed on billionaire finance. What should follow is an aesthetic disposition weary of the (often ineffective) register of resilience , resistance and opposition that defangs art of its edge, masquerading impotence behind stultifying moral appraisal. Our pervasive sense of meltdown should be consonant with a libidinal politics of decline, and young African artists are already beginning to pick their teeth with the remains of the day. A standout exhibition from the preceding year was Cape Town-based gallery Vela Projects’ Kash Out , presenting works by South African artist Boytchie (aka Phillip Newman). Division is neither denounced nor remedied in the joyfully macabre Schemin (2024) or matter-of-fact Muney Up (2024). My Precious (2024) by Boytchie, copyright Vela Projects Those of us who unfashionably cling to the notion of an avant-garde recall its origin in the French term for ‘advance guard’: why oppose when you could always pierce through? For African artists, intimately familiar with landscapes marred by decline and uneven centres, contemporary art’s self-cannibalisation is beatifying. It’s been two years since Barbie (2023) and Oppenheimer (2023) showed that apocalypse can be pink, bubbly and plastic. Have you heard of Nano Le Face? He’s our Warhol; he’s like if Hieronymus Bosch had his heart broken by a Constantia girl with a ludicrously capacious handbag. Nano Le Face, I don&apos;t wanna be real with you rn, R2,300.00 ex. VAT, buy on Latitudes The question of contemporary art’s instrumental value in effecting political change will have to contend with what appears to be a broad rejection of progressive politics. The subject of what, if anything, arrives after the contemporary becomes paramount to the art field at large. Is such a revaluation of values feasible beyond the contemporary as a paradigm rooted in morbid self-reflection? This remains to be seen. For now, and the foreseeable future, contemporary art should perhaps heed those immortal words of W.B. Yeats: … And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? Author Timothy Gawaya is a writer and doctoral researcher at the University of Pretoria. His primary research interests include philosophy of art, digital aesthetics, and modern and contemporary art.</description>

      <description>Diriyah Art Futures: A New Media Art hub building bridges between global cultures with cutting-edge technologies Diriyah Art Futures Official Launch, Diriyah Art Futures© ------------------- Diriyah Art Futures (DAF), the Middle East and North Africa’s first dedicated New Media Art hub, has launched in, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with a vision in mind – to establish itself regionally and globally as an interdisciplinary and innovative hub where art, technology, and cultural heritage converge. Located in the historic UNESCO World Heritage Site of Diriyah, this pioneering initiative by the Saudi Museums Commission highlights the Kingdom’s commitment to redefining the global art landscape. Alongside its official launch, DAF has initiated its inaugural exhibition, ‘Art Must Be Artificial: Perspectives of AI in the Visual Arts’, a showcase of the evolution of computer art from the 1960s to the present day. Among the captivating artworks featured in DAF’s inaugural exhibition is Interstices Opus III (2022) by Haythem Zakaria, a Tunisian transdisciplinary artist whose practice is deeply rooted in cosmogony and spirituality. This 22-minute 4K video projection explores the mythical and archetypal landscapes of North Africa’s Atlas Mountains, connecting ancient narratives to modern artistic inquiry. Haythem Zakaria, Interstices Opus III, Courtesy of Diriyah Art Futures, 2022 © Zakaria’s work draws upon the theories of Romanian religious historian and mythologist Mircea Eliade, who postulated that human rituals often mirror divine archetypes, offering a timeless connection between the terrestrial and the transcendent. Filmed across Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco , Interstices Opus III summons the Atlas Mountains as both a geographical and symbolic topos. Through his collection and reinterpretation of cultural data, Zakaria explores the intersection of collective memory, spirituality, and art. The piece invites viewers to reconsider their perceptions of the landscape, examining the mythological dimensions that continue to shape human understanding. Zakaria’s artistic journey reflects a profound engagement with both traditional and contemporary mediums, weaving disciplines like sociology, ethnography, and economy into his practice. His Interstices is a testament to his ability to craft immersive stories that are as conceptually rigorous as they are visually stunning. Complementing Zakaria’s cosmogonic exploration is the work of Saudi artist Lulwah Al-Homoud, whose pieces in the exhibition, including Perpetual Codes (2022), explore the intricate beauty of Islamic geometric patterns. Her practice is informed by extensive research into the cultural and scientific knowledge embedded within these designs, which, while mathematical, possess a sense of freedom and organic evolution. Lulwah Al-Homoud, Perpetual Codes, 2022, Courtesy of Diriyah Art Futures© In Perpetual Codes , a digital animation supported by the Saudi Ministry of Culture, Al-Homoud creates an interplay between tradition and innovation. Her approach to tessellation transcends rigidity, transforming lines and shapes into fluid, infinite perspectives that echo the interconnectedness of existence. Al-Homoud’s abstract visual language, grounded in balance and harmony, offers viewers a meditative experience, revealing the profound spiritual and aesthetic dimensions of geometry. As an established artist and founder of the Riyadh-based LAHAF Art Foundation, Al-Homoud’s contributions to global art underscore the importance of cultural heritage in contemporary artistic practices. Her works form a bridge between historical knowledge and the possibilities of the digital age, making her a vital voice in the region’s New Media Art movement. DAF’s programming extends beyond static exhibitions, exemplified by the live performance of Transient (2020) by multimedia artist Quayola during the opening festivities. This audiovisual concert, created in collaboration with the musician and technologist Seta, featured motorised pianos and video projections reminiscent of impressionist brushstrokes. Transient is a striking exploration of the coalescence of human creativity and machine intelligence, with real-time improvisations that balance anthropic and technological forces. The performance underscored DAF’s role as a platform for the convergence of art and technology, offering audiences an immersive experience that redefines the possibilities of creative expression. Transient performance by Quayola in collaboration with SETA, Courtesy of Diriyah Art Futures© Through its inaugural exhibition and visionary programming, Diriyah Art Futures is firmly positioning itself as a global hub for New Media and Digital Art. By presenting the works of local and regional talents alongside international innovators, DAF embodies its core mission: to reshape the potential of artistic expression in a fashion that is connected to the world but wired for the region. In a sense, DAF’s broader vision transcends mere exhibition, encompassing a comprehensive slate of initiatives designed to stimulate interdisciplinary exploration. From masterclasses and workshops that engage participants in hands-on experiences to residencies that empower artists and scholars to create groundbreaking work, DAF cultivates a fertile landscape for innovation and collaboration. These programmes are designed to equip emerging talents and seasoned professionals alike with the tools to navigate and contribute to the rapidly evolving art world. Miguel Chevalier, Extra Natural 2018, Courtesy of Diriyah Art Futures© As the first dedicated New Media Art hub in the Middle East and North Africa, DAF’s location in the historic Diriyah district, the birthplace of the First Saudi State, offers a unique backdrop where tradition meets modernity. This confluence of past and future enables the institution to act as a bridge, bringing global perspectives into dialogue with the rich artistic and cultural legacies of the region. With its bold commitment to innovation, Diriyah Art Futures stands at the forefront of the global art ecosystem. It is a space where the boundaries between tradition and technology, the physical and the digital, and the real and the artificial are continuously interrogated and redefined – generating a future where art not only reflects but actively shapes our understanding of the world.</description>

      <description>The Latitudes Art Fund In partnership with META foundation Photography Credit: Maurine Tric/ Institut Francais Afrique du Sud The Latitudes Art Fund aims to provide financial support to visual artists by covering the cost of essential art supplies, enabling them to continue their creative pursuits without the economic burden of material expenses. Art materials, from high-quality paints and canvases to sculpting tools and digital equipment, are often prohibitively expensive, especially for emerging and independent artists. This fund seeks to bridge that gap, ensuring that lack of resources does not limit artistic potential and innovation. By empowering artists with access to the tools they need, we foster a vibrant and inclusive creative community where artistic voices from diverse backgrounds can thrive. Latitudes Limited was launched in 2019, and is a movement to make contemporary art from Africa accessible, inclusive and impactful. In line with this, every purchase of a Latitudes Limited multiple directly supports African artists, with a portion of proceeds feeding directly into the Latitudes Art Fund in partnership with META Foundation. Latitudes donates 10% of the proceeds of a sale of a Latitudes Limited print and the featured artist has the choice to donate a further 10%. This makes each Latitudes Limited purchase an act of art patronage, in times where community is needed more than ever. Operating through an application-based process, which will open in March 2025, artists can apply for grants on a rolling basis. Selection criteria will include artistic merit, financial need, and the potential impact of the fund on the artist&apos;s career. In doing so, the Art Fund not only promotes creative growth but also strengthens the larger art ecosystem by supporting artists at their foundation—their tools and materials. Photography credit: Willem Potgieter A selection committee from the META foundation and Latitudes will select the winners. The grant values will be the same (an amount decided on based on the amount of money in the fund). The META foundation will then manage the payment of the grants to the art supplier ensuring that each winning applicant receives a voucher for their amount. The fund seeks investment through art sales on Latitudes Online and direct donations. Latitudes is to facilitate these sales and donations with all monies managed by META foundation - a registered PBO. Any individuals or companies donating funds are eligible for an income tax write off to the value of the donation. The META foundation will issue these.</description>

      <title>Between the Painting and I</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/between-the-painting-and-i</link>
      <description>Between the Painting and I By Denzo Nyathi Kirsten Sims, Read My Mind, 2024, R90,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY --------------- Brushstroke by brushstroke, through generations of reiterations and movements, ‘the painting’ has become so ubiquitous as to almost become a synonym for ‘art’ by and large. No short of thanks to the canon, most of the masterpieces of yester-art that readily come to mind are oil paintings by the likes of Van Gogh and Da Vinci. Being cautious to not equate traditional Western art practices with art itself, it’s a worthwhile reminder to consider how even tens of thousands of years ago, paintings were being painted on the rocky walls of caves in ancient societies of the Global South. In some way, the presence of a painting on every wall — from the pristine white finish of a gallery to the prehistoric archive of a cave — can be somewhat overwhelming. How has the language of paint transcended race, time, geography and cultural context? In that same breath, there is something beautifully profound about painting. Indeed, how has the language of paint transcended race, time, geography and cultural context, if not proof of it as one of those universal languages that enwraps the human experience, like dance, mathematics, and laughter amongst loved ones. I recently had the pleasure of attending Penny Siopis’ live painting demonstration, as a part of The Centre for the Less Good Idea’s Showing the Making series. With a large-scale blank canvas, ink, a bucket of water and an abundance of cold glue, the master painter took the audience through her complex thought processes around creating. Albeit impossible to condense and do justice to the thought process of an artist who has been working on her craft for 40+ years, there was one take away which has beautifully haunted me. “[One] of these fundamental questions in any image making is when we decide what is the figure and what is the ground, and why in fact do we think the figure is more important?” She mused, beginning to share aloud her thoughts on relationality and materiality. “There’s no such thing as a background. Everything is there. Figure, ground, figure, ground, figure, ground.” Penny Siopis at The Centre for The Less Good Idea In these early stages of delivering one of her iconic abstract paintings, she was unearthing truths about painting by pointing to the nature of painting itself. In highlighting the (mostly) two-dimensional plane upon which the work lives, Siopis speaks to an interesting way in which images spatially relate to one another in the painting itself. They are not bound to the same laws of three-dimensional living that their captive human viewers audiences are. Forms are intrinsically bound to one another, in spite of divisive lines and colours that might optically demarcate them. Their plane is different; it is a plane where depth is illuded into being, and not born into. Herein lies (an element of) the allure of painting. In a painter’s sacred rituals of transfiguration, they become a bridge between our world and its laws, and the world of a painting. In the case of figurative paintings, we recognise the work as a representation of a person, or a thing, and not that person or thing itself. The representation does not — cannot — bear the same gravitas and weight of that which it represents. Yet, in its immortalisation, it holds a different relationship to time, that asks us to think and feel differently. Perhaps the painting is not the “real” thing, but it immortalises a very real moment in time, in which the painter and their subject extensively engaged. The finest of paintings are able to in some way communicate the tensions between the perceiver (painter) and the perceived (subject). On the same evening of the live painting demonstration, Siopis spoke more about returning to paintings days later, changing their orientation, and re-negotiating with the then-dried works as to what more might be needed. This recalls that visceral, deep feeling in the gut, as one looks down some great opening of the earth, and can almost feel it looking back up at you. In the case of some of the finest abstract paintings, the works are a call-to-search to not just their painters, but their audiences to come. It is often a search that requires a head tilt, a step back, a step forward and a polite ask to the person beside you: “what do you think it means?” Chuma Adam, Untitled III, 2024, R8,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Layer after layer of paint application (sometimes to the point of edging figuration into abstraction) dry to solidify a tension that cannot be undone. Indeed, a tension that has never been undone. These renderings of process, figures and emotions have pulled at the heart strings of global audiences for millenia. And in encountering just the right painting, one can understand why. Although a universal language, when one comes across the right painting, it raises so many personal questions of relationality. How is it that this painter has managed to invoke these feelings within me, with so minimal a brushstroke and colour palette? How is it that the painter has captured an experience of mine that once felt like mine alone, and so strikingly? By that same virtue, how is it that the painting has connected me to a collective memory? These questions come back to the marvels of painting, as it transcends our traditional understandings of relationality. In the distance between the painting and I, I simultaneously stand in the place of a million viewers before me, while having an intimate history of my own with the painting that looks back at me. The silent prowess of the painting, in its ability to look back at us and challenge us, obscures the relationship between perceiver and the perceived. No fore, no ground. Just limitless possibility for connection. Moses Zibor, Broken egg, rooster and golden fish, 2022, Price on request, ENQUIRE</description>

      <title>Beyond the Status Quo: Bridging the artistic divide</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/beyond-the-status-quo-bridging-the-artistic-divide</link>
      <description>Beyond the Status Quo: Bridging the artistic divide By Oratile Mosimanekgosi ----------- Exhibitions that launch in August have always made me uneasy. They often seem hastily assembled, driven by a desire to spotlight women artists simply because it’s Women’s Month. This approach often feels superficial, lacking the depth and articulation needed to create meaningful dialogue within the art community. However, a recent exhibition I stumbled upon while scrolling through Instagram might have changed my mind. It was a breath of fresh air to see Mary Sibande and Emma Coppola featured together in the recent exhibition titled ‘Steelwool and Other Paradoxes’, curated by Boitumelo Makousu and Denzo Nyathi. Sibande’s work, particularly her alter ego ‘Sophie,’ was translated into an immersive installation of purple, tentacle-like soft sculptures. These sculptures hung from the ceiling, creating an environment through which viewers could move, enveloped in the themes of Black femininity, labour, and post-colonial identity. ‘Sophie’, a character that Sibande has cultivated over the years, acts as a bridge between personal history and collective memory. Her presence in the exhibition was a powerful reminder of the ongoing reclamation of Black female identity in post-apartheid South Africa. Sibande’s Sophie transcends time, embodying the struggles and triumphs of the women in her family and beyond. The installation doesn’t just invite viewers to observe; it demands engagement, challenging them to consider the weight of history and the persistence of these themes in contemporary life. This ability to traverse the space between the past and the present is what makes Sibande’s work so compelling. It raises important questions about the body, identity, and the role of art in reclaiming narratives that have long been marginalized. In contrast, Emma Coppola’s video installation ‘Soft Skin, No Touch’ offers a more intimate yet equally unsettling exploration of the female body. The close-up footage of a woman wearing stockings pierced with needles, carefully stroking them as if they were strands of hair, is both striking and deeply unsettling. This image captures the paradox of the female body as both vulnerable and untouchable, a symbol of how women navigate societal pressures and expectations. The delicate interaction with the needles, which are ostensibly meant to protect, highlights the tension between self-preservation and the external demands placed on women to conform to certain ideals of beauty and behaviour. Emma Coppola, Soft Skin - No Touch Still VI What makes this exhibition particularly refreshing is its inclusion of both established and emerging artists. This approach adds layers of depth and richness, allowing for a more dynamic and engaging experience for audiences. The presence of seasoned artists like Sibande provides a foundation of mastery and experience, while young career artists like Coppola bring fresh perspectives and innovative approaches that challenge and expand the boundaries of contemporary art. Balancing exhibitions across the artistic spectrum can enrich the experience for all involved. Exhibitions that feature only established artists may reinforce the status quo, potentially limiting opportunities for growth and exploration. On the other hand, focusing exclusively on emerging talent might miss the depth and context that experienced voices provide. The real power of a well-curated exhibition lies in its ability to bridge these two worlds, creating a dialogue between the old and the new, the familiar and the unknown. The Joburg art scene has the potential to transcend the limitations of reputation and popularity by embracing exhibitions that amplify both emerging and established voices. This approach fosters a diverse, evolving landscape where artistic practices are visible to all and industry tastemakers are challenged. Instead of being rare, such inclusive exhibitions should become the norm, shaping the future of art by linking the past to the present while reflecting the full spectrum of creativity. The key is avoiding the echo chamber, ensuring every artist has the chance to be seen and heard.</description>

      <title>Interview with artist Sharlene Khan</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/interview-with-artist-sharlene-khan</link>
      <description>Steelwool and Other Paradoxes curator, Boitumelo Makousu, interviews participating artist Sharlene Khan Sharlene Khan, Love, loves me not III, 2024, R15,000.00 excluding VAT, CONTACT TO BUY --------- Q: Who is Sharlene Khan? A: I&apos;m from Durban and have a deep appreciation for movies, music, books, and—above all—food. Q: What would you say to your younger self? A: I&apos;d tell her to savor every moment and be kind to herself. Too often, we&apos;re caught up in chasing the next big thing—whether it&apos;s making a name in art, academia, or any other field. We forget to enjoy the present and appreciate the journey. It&apos;s been a tough lesson learning to let go of the constant pursuit and just focus on creating, rather than racing for the next opportunity. The chase takes a toll—mentally, physically, and existentially. We often mask the reality behind our polished social media personas, not showing the grind and sacrifices it takes to stay relevant. Embrace the moment and find joy in the process, rather than just the outcomes Q: Who has influenced your journey through the arts? A: It all started in high school with a transformative teacher who was an artist himself. His passion opened my eyes to art as a viable career and introduced me to exhibitions that shifted my perspective. Initially, I pursued microbiology at university because it seemed practical and expected, but I had a revelatory dream that made me realize I couldn&apos;t spend my life in a lab. I switched paths, and my art teacher&apos;s support was crucial—he even convinced my mother that I was meant to be an artist. Despite her initial disappointment, a family prophecy helped her come around. At university in Durban, the theory courses were enlightening, offering insights into decolonial education and critical theories. However, the practice side was rigid, forcing specialization without much room for exploration. It wasn&apos;t until I encountered Black feminist epistemologies that my thinking expanded profoundly. Realizing Durban&apos;s art scene was limited, I moved to Johannesburg and pursued an MA in Fine Art. Though I faced challenges, including being blacklisted for addressing racism in my work, this adversity pushed me to delve deeper into my research interests. My PhD journey abroad provided a much-needed break from South Africa, allowing me to refine my focus and appreciate my roots. Now, I navigate a dual career in academia and art. Teaching has become a fulfilling aspect of my life, despite the bureaucracy, while my art practice remains a constant passion. Inspired by Toni Morrison&apos;s approach to writing what you wish existed, I create and research to fill gaps in representation and address topics that matter to me. The art world has its challenges, including financial instability, but it fuels my creative drive and ongoing commitment to my craft. Q:What are your current thoughts on writing in the art world and academia? A: There’s a significant deficit in writing within the visual arts, art history, and art criticism in South Africa. Instead of using criticism to deeply engage with artworks and expand our creative knowledge, it often gets weaponized to undermine individuals. This lack of investment from commercial galleries in meaningful discourse around artists’ works is troubling. Galleries don’t seem to grasp that establishing a lasting dialogue around an artist’s work enriches both the understanding of the art and its cultural and monetary value. We rarely see comprehensive catalogs or books accompanying exhibitions, which leaves a gap that falls on individuals to fill. This gap presents a remarkable opportunity to address ongoing issues with Western aesthetics in South African and African art contexts. Writing should be viewed not just as a historical account but as a creative methodology that complements and expands the creative process. Instead of merely describing, writing should enhance and deepen our understanding of the work, offering new perspectives and extending the creativity inherent in the art itself. It should be seen as an integral part of the creative process, enriching both the artwork and our comprehension of it. Q: What is your process for creating a body of work, and how does it evolve? A: My process usually starts with an idea that persists and evolves over time. It can linger for months or even years before manifesting in any tangible form. This idea continually resurfaces, presenting itself in my thoughts and dreams until it demands attention. Visualizations begin to align with this concept, often inspired by personal experiences or themes like love, race, or national identity. For me, each medium has its own unique process. With painting, especially in oil, I think through the medium itself. It involves wrestling with form and layering, and often, the final piece emerges differently from what I initially envisioned. The process is less about achieving a specific outcome and more about letting the painting reveal itself. Photography, on the other hand, involves a lot of focus on composition. I don’t see myself as a photographer in the traditional sense, so I’m less concerned with technical perfection and more interested in using images that tell a story, regardless of their quality. Video work introduces another layer of complexity. It requires careful consideration of how video as a medium communicates effectively. I often start by writing a script, inspired by a key line or concept that emerges. Writing is straightforward for me; I can sit down and draft a script in one go, but the editing process is intricate. As video projects become more elaborate, coordinating with others and translating my vision into practical terms becomes a learning experience. Overall, the common thread across all mediums is the persistence of the core idea. It remains central throughout the creative process, driving the work forward until it feels fully realized. Q: What is the intended message behind your work &quot;When the moon wanes&quot;? A: The work is deeply personal, reflecting my experience of coming of age in 1995, a time when I navigated an interracial relationship amidst complex social and political dynamics. It explores the emotional turbulence of young love—how we carry our personal baggage, the pain of heartbreak, and the unrealistic expectations placed on romantic relationships. When my heart was first broken, it was a profound moment of personal growth. I learned that heartbreak isn’t just about the end of a relationship but about how we process and move on from it. Many narratives focus on the dramatic end of love, but I’m interested in what happens afterward. How do we continue to love and live after a deep hurt? The work connects personal experiences with broader myths and epic love stories from various cultures, focusing not just on the pain of heartbreak but on the resilience and ongoing journey of love. It reflects on how broken hearts are not just about individual loss but also about the collective experiences of women who have endured and grown from their pain. The piece considers love as a foundation within ourselves rather than as something that completes us or fulfills a cultural ideal. It’s about recognizing that you are love itself and that you have the power to shape how you extend love to others. The work reflects on the cliché of “He Loves Me Not” and the deeper truth of self-love and self-worth. It explores how love, despite its challenges, can be a source of personal strength and transformation, expressed through various forms of creative and personal expression. Q: As one of the founders of the African Feminism Conference, and what are the conference&apos;s objectives and significance? The African Feminism Conference was founded in 2017 by three pracititioners from the fields of humanities, literary studies, English, and fine arts. Our goal was to highlight how creativity is deeply embedded in the lives of African women. It’s not just confined to exhibitions or musical performances but is woven into every aspect of our daily lives—from fashion and hairstyle to how we express love and identity. The conference aims to bring together African and Black feminists to explore and present their experiences and theories. Central to this is showcasing creativity in various forms—whether through theater, poetry recitals, music, or visual art. Unlike traditional conferences where artworks might be displayed passively, our conference integrates creative presentations with conventional academic papers. We have sessions that feature creative works alongside scholarly papers, ensuring a dynamic exchange between artistic and academic practices. The conference includes book launches, artistic interventions, and immersive experiences to keep participants engaged and to foster dialogue between theorists and creatives. AFEMS serves as a vibrant social network where African and Black feminists can freely express their ideas without concern for external judgment. It creates a supportive community for nuanced discussions and encourages young scholars and emerging artists to present their work and receive constructive feedback. The conference also provides opportunities for publication, networking, and mentorship, particularly for emerging women artists and academics. Q: Where is Sharlene now, and what are you looking forward to? A: I&apos;m 47 now, and I&apos;ve realized that I&apos;ve spent the last two decades constantly striving for various goals, forgetting to truly enjoy life along the way. This has led to a bit of a midlife crisis, compounded by the loss of my parents nearly a decade ago. Losing my childhood home and coming to terms with chronic illness have made me reflect on how much my life has changed. Midlife is like doing an accounting of your life, and I was never good at accounting—my books never balanced. But instead of feeling bad about that, I&apos;m learning to accept it. I&apos;ve contributed enough to the history of visual arts to earn my place, and I don&apos;t need to exhaust myself writing the next book or giving the next talk. If history forgets me, then so be it. Now, I&apos;m focusing on things that bring me joy. I want to learn how to roller skate, swim properly, and speak Zulu. I&apos;ve already started roller skating, and even though I&apos;ve fallen and injured myself, I’m learning to embrace it. Watching kids fall and get back up reminds me that you can&apos;t skate properly without learning how to fall. I&apos;ve also realized that I need to find enjoyment outside of my work and identity. I want something separate from the pressures of my job, so I&apos;m exploring these new interests. Last year, I recognized that I was at a midlife crisis point, and after going through the typical clichés—like getting a new car—I understood that I was just covering up deeper issues. I&apos;m on a journey to figure out who I am beyond my roles and responsibilities. What does it mean to be this person who no longer has to care for others all the time, who no longer has to strive for validation in the art world? It’s a big journey, one that won’t be completed in a year or two. Art is still a part of my life, but now it&apos;s more about enjoyment rather than trying to meet the art world&apos;s expectations. I&apos;m also working on getting rid of toxic behaviors, both towards others and myself. I want to learn to enjoy my life without worrying about making history or being remembered. Who cares, really? I’ve spent so much of my life focused on others, and now I realize that I only have this one life. So, maybe for the next few years, I’ll focus on doing things that bring me pure joy, even if they seem selfish. I&apos;m not looking to the future with specific goals in mind—I&apos;m just trying to be present and enjoy the moment. Even though I often feel like I&apos;m on the verge of giving up, there’s always another project on my mind. I have a few projects that are halfway done, and I need to wrap them up before I take stock of everything. I want to focus on writing about things and people I truly love. Sharlene Khan, Love, loves me not I, 2024, R15,000.00 excluding VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Q: What do you feel was your proudest moment or accomplishment? A: Creating the series &quot;When the Moon Wanes&quot; is probably the achievement I&apos;m most proud of. It was based on the lives of my mother and grandmother, and finding the right language to articulate their experiences was incredibly challenging. It took a long time to bring it to life, but the impact it had on people when they viewed it made all the effort worth it. Q: What advice would you give to young women? A: Honestly, I don’t really have advice anymore. I’d say, don’t be afraid to mess up. Life can feel overwhelming and harsh, and mistakes might seem like they’ll define you forever, but they don’t. Life gives you chances to correct your course, so if you mess up, just move on and be kind to yourself. Figure out what self-love truly means beyond all the clichés. Self-love isn’t just about taking bubble baths when you’re mentally falling apart. While that might offer temporary relief, it doesn’t address the underlying issues. If you’re struggling, seek therapy, talk to people, and do the hard work of healing and changing your mindset. Overcoming negative thought patterns and manifesting the life you want requires a lot of effort, especially in a society that keeps us constantly spinning our wheels. But it’s worth it to take that time and effort for your well-being.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/meet-our-2024-anna-award-winner</link>
      <description>Introducing the 2024 ANNA Award winner! -------------------------------------------------------------------- XANTHE SOMERS -------------------------------------------------------------------- &quot;I am deeply honored to be selected as this year&apos;s ANNA Award winner, especially among such a remarkable group of finalists. I want to extend my deepest gratitude for this recognition and the opportunities it brings. This award will undoubtedly enhance my artistic career, offering new avenues for creative exploration and growth. It is vital to spotlight and elevate the voices of female African artists on the global stage, as our unique perspectives and stories contribute richly to the world&apos;s cultural tapestry.&quot; Xanthe Somers was born and went to school in Harare, Zimbabwe. She graduated from Michealis School of Fine Art, UCT in Cape Town in 2015- she went on to be awarded a grant to study a MA Postcolonial Culture and Global Policy at Goldsmiths, University of London which she completed in 2020 with distinction. Xanthe Somers&apos;s practice is informed by the politics of aesthetics, and more significantly how the colonial history in Zimbabwe continues to manipulate aesthetic values. Her work as a ceramic sculptor looks at reimagining everyday life and examining the subtle treason of objects. Through a sense of play, bright colours, mocking tone and exaggerated shapes, the artist tries to challenge the prevailing ideas associated with normalcy, beauty and refinement which have been manipulated by the Christian-Colonial gaze fixed strongly on southern Africa. Xanthe recently completed the GUILD artist residency, for two months with Southern Guild in Cape Town, South Africa, March-May 2024. “As an artist who works directly with themes of ‘women’s work’ and domesticity, I am honoured to be chosen for an award that gives female voices a space to be heard and recognised, as well as shedding light on their subject matter.” And meet the ANNA Audience Award Winner -------------------------------------------------------------------- Yaknoabasi Jessicah Ene -------------------------------------------------------------------- In my artistic journey, I delve into the profound realms of sisterhood, women&apos;s empowerment, and the divine feminine. Shaped by the nurturing bonds within my predominantly female family, my work aims to illuminate the varied roles of women and address the challenges they navigate. Each creation is a testament to my idealistic vision of societal development, capturing the essence of unity and strength inherent in sisterhood. Empowerment, a recurring theme, resonates through my art, advocating for the elevation of women in all facets of life. The divine feminine, a source of inspiration, lends a spiritual and transcendent dimension to my work, celebrating the inherent grace and power within every woman. Through diverse mediums, my art mirrors the dynamic interplay of surroundings, personal experiences, and an ever-evolving imagination. As I navigate this continuous learning journey as an emerging artist, my central goal remains to educate, heal, and inspire, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable world by spotlighting the beauty and resilience of women. “Being an ANNA Award finalist means a lot to me; it shows that my hard work hasn’t gone unnoticed.

      <title>Lawrence Calver, Infinitely Gentle</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/collecting/lawrence-calver-infinitely-gentle</link>
      <description>LAWRENCE CALVER – INFINITELY GENTLE ------------------ - by Ashraf Jamal The Swiss-English artist, Lawrence Calver, is in love with Rothko, though he is no painter. Sewing, dyeing, bleaching, are the integral elements in the creation of his art. The sewing machine was at the ready on his arrival at his studio at the Cape Town Art Residency, the location of which could not be more fitting – the city’s now defunct clothing and textile hub. Destroyed by the sweatshops in the East, this semi-industrial hub sputters on, its central artery, Victoria Road, lined with stores selling bolts and off-cuts. In its depleted state, the textile industry speaks reams about port cities as the critical global interface in the maritime era. What we now think of as a peculiarly West African textile, for example, is anything but. Lawrence Calver, portrait, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina Calver and I are discussing ‘mud cloth’, a cotton fabric whose cultural significance is deemed African, its putative place of origin, Mali. However, maritime historians tell a very different story in which Coromandel, in India, is recognised as the key point of export of cloth. Arriving in Kilwa, on the East coast of Africa, where, vividly, and unforgettably, bolts were exchanged for elephant tusks (deployed as picket fences!), the cloth then journeyed upward and westward. This transaction and migration, along with Dutch control of the industry in Europe, before a British takeover, tells us some revealing truths – that points of origin are always misnomers, that the history of material culture is complex, nations and continents implicated in a rich tapestry – in this case the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and Europe. That Calver’s great-grandfather was a Swiss trader in cloth and skins between Asia and Europe, further underscores this intimate genealogy. Lawrence Calver in studio at the Cape Town Art Residency, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina Calver is an abstract artist, his focus is textility – the text as tissue, as ‘a ready-made veil’, but also as a ‘generative idea that the text is made, is worked out in a perpetual interweaving’. Here, Roland Barthes is intrigued by a language game – text-textile-techne, and the Latin root, texere, to weave. This overlay – everything is thus, intertextual – is especially compelling for Calver, whose construction and generation of meaning, as text, is integrally connected to the stitching and allocation of off-cuts. That he works on both sides of a thinly transparent canvas – attentive always to light, the greatest influencer in design – and colour blocking – the vital language of his work – is telling. A variant of reverse glass painting? Not quite. For what primarily inspires Calver is the mood of a ‘collaged’ work. Lawrence Calver, Untitled, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina I’m not sure if collage is a fitting descriptor. After all, for Max Ernst, collage supposes the combination of dissonant materials on a plane that is further disjunctive. Calver, however, produces large canvases in which unevenly cut textiles are sewn together into an irresistibly beautiful and gentle concert. Aurally, I’m reminded of the music of Eric Satie, of sounds as limpid, as soft, as easeful, for this, undoubtedly, is the mood and sonography of Calver’s art. There is, for instance, a patchwork, rather than collage, composed in a symphony of pink, with elements of blue and orange subtly integrated. In the composition, pieces are cut and shifted about. If the colour field is deemed too strong, too stringent, the composition is then bleached, or, inversely, redyed. Colour is never a given in Calver’s world. And if Rothko is a core inspiration, it is because he understood the integral and numinous matter of light. Lawrence Calver, in his studio at the Cape Town Art Residency, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina Calver declares that he ‘brings out what is already there’. This supposes an artist who treads exceptionally lightly, who refuses the imposition, say, of ego, for whom composition is an intuitive, even Taoistic, exercise, that allows as much for release as it does composition. Here, again, Satie returns to me as an infinitely gentle – though not infinitely suffering – thing, for his world, like Calver’s, and unlike T.S. Eliot’s to which I’m inferring, holds little interest in pain, whether psychic or physical. Rather, Calver is wholly immersed in the sonority and beauty of the world. Indeed, a work is completed only when he sees ‘the beauty in it’. Lawrence Calver, in his studio at the Cape Town Art Residency, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina That Calver doesn’t like his ‘hand being in the work’ further illuminates the nature of its making, in which removal is not detachment. The hand, typically, is integral in the making of craft and art. Calver’s hand, or hands, and presumably a foot attached to a sewing peddle, assume a constructive interposition when stitching the work. But when it comes to dyeing and bleaching? Surely here hands get ‘dirty’ as it were? That Calver insists upon the withdrawal of the hand in art, must refer to something other, given that its presence is irrefutable. I think that Calver’s conceit hangs on desire – what he wishes the viewer to experience and see, which is not the mechanics of their making but the sonority of their unique being. His is a vision of art that is transcendental and sacramental. Lawrence Calver, in his studio at the Cape Town Art Residency, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina This ideal in no way overrides the fact that the making of his art requires not only a sewing machine but ‘a mental drive and physical process’. Calver’s core point, however, concerns the economy of reception of his work – how it is seen, what it is seen to be, how it is felt, or intuited – which favours the sacral, typically associated with Rothko’s paintings. This predilection on the part of the artist is not a personal quirk, but historical. That abstraction now dominates the global optic in the artworld is, in fact, unsurprising. After all, after a recent and still current history consumed by moral piety and sententiousness, by rage and divisiveness, the artworld finds itself exhausted. Now, identity politics holds comparatively little sway. Now, we no longer care to be told what to think, or when to shut our mouths. Now, we find ourselves returning to consolatory art. As Matisse famously remarked, on returning home after a tiring day at work, the businessman wishes for nothing more than to kick off his heels, slump into a cosy armchair, and behold a restful work of art. Lawrence Calver, Untitled, photo credit: Yulia Zhilina This is Lawrence Calver’s goal. He well knows that abstraction is not an intellectual game, but the stuff created by theosophists and mystics. It is that tradition, inspired by wonder, drawn to beatific contiguities, which he has made his own. One particularly splendid work has stayed with me. Calver has worked on both sides of the thin canvas, drained the colour, so that what we see, barring one irregularly shaped block of ox blood red, is a subtle compound of striped and matte creams, with one blob of creamy yellow. Nougat comes to mind, something milky. But this, contra Barthes, is not milk that turns, but a milk, some balm of pale custard with slivers of berry, which is utterly soothing. Because now, we are done with moral peacocks, done with noise. Now, we linger longer, inhabit the world more slowly, gently … kindly. Enquires</description>

      <description>Collector Profile Meet creative entrepreneur Annicia Manyaapelo ---------------- In this exclusive interview, collector Annicia Manyaapelo shares her journey through the art world, as well as invaluable advice on collecting. Annicia Manyaapelo is a creative entrepreneur, founder of NichLuxe - an Art and Luxury consultancy and Women Who Collect - a global platform for women art collectors and investors. Latitudes&apos; head of editorial and marketing, Chelsea Selvan, sat down with Annicia to delve into her art-collecting journey as she revealed her favourite six works featured on Latitudes Online. Read more below. Why did you start collecting art? Once you immerse yourself in the Art world, you really start to see yourself reflected in the works by different artists. I also love to see artists thrive and this is a major reason to invest in their success. Thero Makepe, Mama Mo Metsing, 2019, price on request Chelsea Selvan (CS): Tell us a bit about yourself, how did you land up doing what you&apos;re doing? Annicia Manyaapelo (AM): Having worked at Zeitz MOCAA as Head of Marketing and Communications, I became acutely aware of how museums and art galleries are still intimidating for most people. And having spent the bulk of my career in Corporate, I still have friends who have money, are well traveled and live well. These accomplished women find it easier to walk into Louis Vuitton, Gucci or Chanel to buy expensive luxury bags yet find it daunting to spend money on art. These combined personal experiences led me to launch WomenWhoCollect with the aim of supporting Women in their Art collecting journey. WomenWhoCollect during Investec Cape Town Art Fair Attend exhibitions, artist walkabouts and art fairs. This will help you understand what type of works and artists move you and are worthy of your investment.

Ts&amp;Cs apply . The ANNA Award winner will be announced Wednesday 7 August, in celebration of Women&apos;s Month. Spread the word! Ethel Aanyu Ethel Aanyu is a Ugandan photographer living and working in Kampala, Uganda. In 2018 she completed a BA in Industrial and Fine Arts from Makerere University. In 2020 she presented her work in the Kampala Art Biennale as an apprentice Andrew Tshabangu’s studio. In her work she employs digital layering techniques of positive and negative black and white images and coloured inverted images. Mainly using herself as a model and other people too, she stages scenes that portray visual self-reflections. Aanyu’s creative process begins with a question that arises or that she intentionally calls to her mind. She describes that what we see in her work is similar to talking to oneself, mentally conversing, in various ways, sometimes in form of a heated dispute, other times as a gentle conversation. The negative and positive layers in the photographs each represent one of the conversing parties. There is no final answer presented to the questions she asks. Rather, the artist is carving a space in which one doesn&apos;t have to be one or the other – a space in-between within which one can nd comfort and calmness amidst tension, ambiguity and hybridity. The performative process creates a space for her own self-reflection and growth, providing moments of unapologetically being herself, being inquisitive without having to present solutions. I am behind and in front of the camera, Aanyu says, Being that person is a fulfilment to me. I feel more attached to the image, because it is me. I am being myself. “Being an ANNA Award finalist is a profound honor that recognizes the dedication and passion behind my work. It signifies not only personal achievement but also the validation of my artistic voice and the stories I strive to tell through my photography. This recognition fuels my commitment to continue exploring and expressing the human condition through my art.” - Ethel Aanyu Isabella Maake Isabella Maake is a contemporary visual artist from South Africa, where her love for creating blossomed. Living with profound hearing loss from a young age, she has used art as a medium of expression and dreamed of becoming a full-time artist. After completing her undergraduate degree in Graphic Design, she went on to work as a graphic journalist for Media24, where she won several Standard Bank Sikuvile Journalism Awards, including Upcoming/Rising Star of the Year in 2017 and Graphic Journalist of the Year in 2020. Maake&apos;s art is deeply personal and explores themes of identity, dualism, and vulnerability– mostly depicted through portraiture and figurative art. As an artist who is deaf, she draws inspiration from the conceptual state of ‘in-betweenness’ and the possibilities that can exist between two contradictory things such as, black and white; past and present; hearing and deaf; and so on. Her subjects are usually people, as she believes each person contains an entire universe and is fascinated by the stories that lie within. As a multidisciplinary artist working primarily in paint, Isabella is driven by the desire to push the boundaries of traditional art forms by experimenting with different mediums and techniques which include painting, photography, sculpture, and interactive sound installations. She hopes to spotlight the beauty of human complexity and the interconnections we can forge despite perceived barriers. Maake&apos;s artworks have been exhibited in group exhibitions at the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in London, and in her hometown of Polokwane, South Africa. In 2023, she was selected as a recipient of the prestigious Chevening leadership scholarship and is currently pursuing her master’s degree in Fine Art in Oxford, England. “Being an ANNA award finalist is both a dream come true and an honour. As an artist who is deaf, this recognition goes beyond my art– it&apos;s a testament to the power of diverse voices in shaping not only South Africa&apos;s but Africa’s artistic and cultural landscape. The ANNA award amplifies the importance of inclusivity in the arts, echoing my journey of exploring the forging of connections despite perceived barriers.” Jana Visser Jana Visser is a textile artist and handweaver originally from Stellenbosch, South Africa. In 2019 she completed her Bachelor studies in Fine Art at Stellenbosch University. In 2021 she obtained a Bachelor’s Diploma in Textile Design from LUCA School of Arts in Ghent, Belgium. In the following year she completed her Master’s in Textile Design also at LUCA School of Arts for which she received a Magna Cum Laude. Her master&apos;s thesis titled, &quot;an emptiness that breathes&quot; was nominated for a Thesis Prize as well as the prestigious Dirk Lauwaert Award. Her work has been exhibited in multiple galleries and institutions in both South Africa and Belgium, including the Design Museum in Ghent, and forms part of private collections in South Africa, Belgium, France and Germany. Recent exhibitions include Verweven/Entrelacés at Schönfeld Gallery, Zomer Salon at Kunsthal Ghent, and I try to imagine how your texture felt like at St. Peter’s Church of Ypres. In October 2022, some of her textile works were on display during Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Her work titled “in the almost” was shortlisted for the LOEWE Foundation Craft Prize of 2023. In May 2024, Visser had her first solo exhibition titled, Breathing Matter , at Queens Brussels Gallery in Brussels, Belgium. Captivated by weaving as both an art-making method and its conceptual capabilities, Visser seeks a logic of reciprocity and becoming through the framework of her weaving practice. Grounding her practice in an openness to uncertainty, she navigates between controlling method and media, whilst considering relationships between matter, time and space. She views this as a source of meaning-making, and a means to explore the viability of sensory perception and embodied experience. Her methods are slow – requiring patience and time in order to grasp both their material and symbolic potency. There is a desire to know more about the self, the value of rhythm and gesture, and how thread may serve as a conduit for accessing a dimension beyond the tangible. Her interest lies in the relation between weaving, breathing and thinking. The inwards-outwards passage of breath provides a symbolic reflection on weaving gestures, which also depend on constant rhythms and the entanglement of seemingly binary forces; the outwards giving horizontal weft and the inwards receiving vertical warp. “As one of 12 finalists for the ANNA Award of 2024, I am grateful for this platform to promote my own tactile vernacular as a South African female textile artist. The ANNA Award serves as an opportunity to solidify my developing weaving practice, and to facilitate a creative flow by providing a necessary space for deepening my applied research into weaving as a method of making and thinking.” Yaknoabasi Jessicah Ene In my artistic journey, I delve into the profound realms of sisterhood, women&apos;s empowerment, and the divine feminine. Shaped by the nurturing bonds within my predominantly female family, my work aims to illuminate the varied roles of women and address the challenges they navigate. Each creation is a testament to my idealistic vision of societal development, capturing the essence of unity and strength inherent in sisterhood. Empowerment, a recurring theme, resonates through my art, advocating for the elevation of women in all facets of life. The divine feminine, a source of inspiration, lends a spiritual and transcendent dimension to my work, celebrating the inherent grace and power within every woman. Through diverse mediums, my art mirrors the dynamic interplay of surroundings, personal experiences, and an ever-evolving imagination. As I navigate this continuous learning journey as an emerging artist, my central goal remains to educate, heal, and inspire, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable world by spotlighting the beauty and resilience of women. “Being an ANNA Award finalist means a lot to me; it shows that my hard work hasn’t gone unnoticed. Reapplying this year and being recognized gives me hope that with dedication, passion, and consistency, I can achieve anything I set my mind to.” Kay-Leigh Fisher Kay-Leigh Fisher is a visual artist, curator and publisher based in Johannesburg, South Africa. She holds an Honours in Curatorship degree from Michaelis School of Fine Art, University of Cape Town (2020) and a Bachelor’s Degree in Fine Art from the University of the Witwatersrand (2019). Her research and practice focuses on themes and narratives of becoming, thinking through familiar relationships with objects and how they reinforce ideals around racial and gendered identity. Fisher was a co-recipient of the Bag Factory Artist Studios Young Womxn Studio Bursary (2022 - 2023) and works as a Programme Associate for the Joburg Contemporary Art Foundation (JCAF). “I am thrilled beyond words to be among the Top 12 finalists for the 2024 ANNA Award! This recognition is a testament to perseverance, dedication and embracing creativity fearlessly.” Leah Rachel Hawker Leah Rachel Hawker (b.1983) is a South African artist. She completed a post-graduate diploma (with distinction) in fine art at the University of Cape Town in 2023 which took an intimate look at the lives and subsequent identities of GenZ women. She completed her initial studies at Ruth Prowse School of Art (with distinction) in 2005 with a body of work that dealt with female stereotyping. Her passion for image making evolved from a fascination with gender roles in society and our shared human condition. By working with thousands of individuals in all contexts and environments over the last 20 years she has gained immense knowledge and understanding of human behavior. It is in both the public and private domain that she has made these observations, those of our fears and vanities: this is what she brings to her work. She published her documentary art book Breastfeeding 101 (ISBN: 978-1-928440-29-1) in 2019. Leah has placed three times, as a finalist, in both the Sasol New Signatures Competition (2009, 2018, current - 2024) and Vuleka Awards (2006, 2022). She was a finalist in the Thami Mnyele Fine Arts, 2021. More recently she has exhibited at the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, the University of Johannesburg and the KKNK. Leah has initiated and worked on a number of curatorial projects, lectured at City Varsity, Western Cape Government seminars and Ruth Prowse Art School. She’s created photo essays for women’s upliftment projects and organizations in South Africa, Tanzania and Sri Lanka to date. She is currently working towards her first solo as well as on a yearlong documentary photo story funded by the National Arts Council on the Madeiran community of Woodstock for exhibition in 2025. “I feel deeply honoured, proud and thrilled to be amongst the 12 women artists selected as finalists for the 2024 ANNA Awards. As an artist working with topics pertaining to the female lived experience the ANNA Awards is a competition I hold high for its focus on women in the arts in Africa. It’s immensely meaningful to be a part of this year’s awards.” Lee-Ann Olwage Lee-Ann Olwage is a visual storyteller from South Africa who uses collaborative storytelling to explore themes relating to gender and identity. She is interested in using the medium of photography as a mode of celebration and aims to create a space where people she collaborates with can play an active part in the creation of images, they feel tells their stories in a way that is affirming and celebratory. Her journey in photography began unexpectedly after studying film directing and scriptwriting. Following her education, she spent nine years working as a set decorator in the film industry, an experience that profoundly shaped her approach to narrative and visual composition. Through this background, Olwage developed a keen eye for capturing not just imagery but also narratives. She is particularly interested in reflecting on the way in which different cultures and communities interpret mental health and stories about education. Through her art, Olwage fosters a sense of community and creates vivid narratives filled with possibility. The Right To Play creates a powerful narrative that sheds light on the challenges faced by millions of girls globally in their pursuit of an education. Every day, girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure and violence. The project poses the question - What do girls dream of? And what happens when a supportive environment is created where girls are empowered and given the opportunity to learn and dream? What does that world look like? The result is a poignant exploration of the dreams and aspirations of young girls, challenging societal expectations that limit their potential. By creating a playful world where girls are not confined by poverty, cultural norms, or violence and instead, is shown through a lens that paints a vivid picture of the possibilities that arise when girls are given the opportunity to learn and dream freely. The Right To Play merges storytelling with an imagined playful world where girls are the shown in an empowered and affirming way blooming as the heroines of their own stories and overcoming the many barriers to getting an education . Her work has been featured in National Geographic, Vogue, The British Journal of Photography, Foam magazine, Geo, The Guardian, Atmos, Vanity Fair Italy, Dazed, Wired, Musee Magazine and IMA Magazine. “I am beyond thrilled to be a finalist for the ANNA award and incredibly grateful for an opportunity to be celebrated amongst other female artists. There is a wealth of rich and visually engaging stories being created on the continent and it is great to see this platform showcasing these bodies of work while supporting and celebrating women artist.” Marie Aimée Fattouche Marie Aimée Fattouche draws inspiration from her fascination with mechanics, whether mental, bodily, or environmental. From simple disruptions to breakdowns, from initial im pulses to the ultimate fluidity of movement, her art navigates the space between repair and sublimation, exploring areas of uncertainty where contradictory possibilities converge. For her, each fracture, whether tangible or abstract, serves as a catalyst for profound transformation. Imbued with her Egyptian roots, her perspective on the organisation of bodies reflects Eas tern perceptions of space. Through her work, she actively interrogates collective narratives and femininity while scrutinizing mechanisms of power and belief systems. Her artistic com positions offer a multitude of perspectives, both spatial and temporal, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in a construction perpetually in motion, transcending mere representation. Following her final MA Fine Art exhibition in 2016 (Chelsea College of Arts, London), M.A Fat touche was awarded the Mercers’ Arts Award. In 2017, as the winner of the Red Mansion Art Prize, she was invited to spend a month of residency in Beijing. In 2019, she had the honor of being among the eight artists shortlisted for the Mark Tanner Sculpture Award at Standpoint Gallery in London (the UK’s most prestigious prize for emerging artists wor king in sculpture). Her work has been exhibited in various institutions, including the Hockney Gallery (2018), and more recently at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MAMC+) in Saint-Étienne as part of the GLOBALISTO exhibition (June to October 2022). In January 2024, she has presented her solo exhibition NOUS INFINIRMON AMOUR at Galerie du Haut-Pavé in Paris. “Life is a Weaving (Etel Adnan). Being part of the ANNA Award community resonates deeply with my identity, symbolizing the essential weaving to the African continent that lies at my core. Being a finalist for the ANNA Award 2024 means I am seen in the powerful web of women-identifying artists from the African continent and its worldwide diaspora. I am honoured to be chosen alongside 11 other artists to let our voices be heard.” Ntsako Nkuna Ntsako Nkuna was born in 2001, Kempton Park Her interdisciplinary practice consists of screen-printed 3D renders and metallic frames reminiscent of structures that act as borders within domestic spaces, which speaks to how architectural structures influence how people interact within a space. Her approach to merging digital and physical mediums was influenced by her exposure to virtual spatiality through the internet and video games, this introduction to vitality has impacted her perceptions of materiality, inhabitation, and world-building, and this led her to consider the idea of world-building outside of virtual reality and into her immediate surroundings. Nkuna&apos;s work also considers how spaces of play such as modular structures borrow their architectural language from physical architectural structures and visa versa. She explored more of the digital world while studying design in high school and had a growing love for digital art and sculpture; these fundamentals have fed into her practice. Her practice aims to think critically about buildings as more than static enclosed structures with a specific function but as structures that acquire their shape based on how they are inhabited, and who they are inhabited by. Silindokuhle Shandu Born in 1998, Johannesburg-based artist Silindokuhle Shandu weaves together themes influenced by her upbringing in a small mining town and her diverse experiences across urban, suburban, and rural South Africa. She completed her diploma in Fashion Design and Technology at Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria. Raised in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal, and eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, Shandu&apos;s artistic journey reflects the complex interplay between womanhood, human existence, industrial landscapes, and the contrasting worlds she has encountered. Her work captures the nuances of her experiences, largely shaped by the women who raised her. Through her use of color, texture, and composition, Shandu invites viewers to explore the tension between belonging and otherness, familiarity and the unknown. &quot;My work is the vehicle which I’ve chosen to reflect on my personal journey and the intricate connections between self-discovery and the ever-evolving environment.&quot; Xanthe Scout Lardner-Burke Xanthe Scout Lardner-Burke (b. 1998, South Africa) is an artist primarily, and recently a curator and writer. Her practice is process-based and expressive of [her] interest in materials, structures, language and value production. Her work of late has been guided by accident and precarity. In painting her substrates are watered down - spilling, slipping and compounding - and necessitating an immediate and responsive sort of working. Therefore paintings begin in one place but can end in another. In turn, sculptures hold trajectories, points or keys. They can inscribe a smaller gesture into the large, gestural work of the paintings. These concerns and working methodologies form a backward or inside-to-outside discussion of structures and signification or value production processes, or the language we give to them. Scout Lardner-Burke graduated from Michaelis School of Fine Art (2021). She has exhibited with 99 Loop Gallery (Cape Town) in Artsy’s Foundations, Untitled 9.99, Elemental, and With Feeling; the Association for Visual Arts in Together; Marvol Gallery in Beyond the Canvas and various independent curatorial projects since her graduation in 2021. In 2023, she participated in Sessions, an eight-month mentorship program, culminating in the exhibition Pomegranate (2023). In 2024 she curated her debut curatorial project Offcuts at the Association for Visual Arts and participated in ARAK Collective’s Critical Art Writing Workshop at RMB Latitudes. Most recently she has exhibited with 99 Loop Gallery at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair, and presented her solo show with the gallery, titled EXIT STRATEGY in April 2024. Scout Lardner-Burke works and lives in Cape Town, South Africa. “I am incredibly excited to be an ANNA Award finalist. It is a fantastic opportunity to develop my practice, and further my engagement with the arts, and their imaginative role in South Africa. Indeed, the ANNA Award would provide me the space, time, and fiscal support to continue and expand my work. It would be an opportunity to make playfully and think expansively - for which I would be very grateful.” Xanthe Somers Xanthe Somers was born and went to school in Harare, Zimbabwe. She graduated from Michealis School of Fine Art, UCT in Cape Town in 2015- she went on to be awarded a grant to study a MA Postcolonial Culture and Global Policy at Goldsmiths, University of London which she completed in 2020 with distinction. Xanthe Somers&apos;s practice is informed by the politics of aesthetics, and more significantly how the colonial history in Zimbabwe continues to manipulate aesthetic values. Her work as a ceramic sculptor looks at reimagining everyday life and examining the subtle treason of objects. Through a sense of play, bright colours, mocking tone and exaggerated shapes, the artist tries to challenge the prevailing ideas associated with normalcy, beauty and refinement which have been manipulated by the Christian-Colonial gaze fixed strongly on southern Africa. Xanthe recently completed the GUILD artist residency, for two months with Southern Guild in Cape Town, South Africa, March-May 2024. “As an artist who works directly with themes of ‘women’s work’ and domesticity, I am honoured to be chosen for an award that gives female voices a space to be heard and recognised, as well as shedding light on their subject matter.”</description>

      <title>Earthbound: Soil and Memory in Contemporary South  African Art</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/earthbound-soil-and-memory-in-contemporary-south-african-art</link>
      <description>Earthbound: Soil and Memory in Contemporary South African Art - by Nkhensani Mkhari Bronwyn Katz oetes (Sweetness) 2024 Sweet thorn, copper, greywacke, sandstone, slate, Atlantic Ocean, quartz, rooigrond (red soil), dassiepis and sound, courtesy of Stevenson I recall with vivid clarity the morning of my youth, bathed in the big sun, bare feet on dusty roads, where we would etch our dreams and stories into the yielding soil. These ephemeral drawings, now understood as my earliest canvases, were the seeds of an enduring bond with the earth. My father, a humble landscaper and conjurer of verdant sanctuaries, fed us by breathing life into space. Every spring, we would transplant growing saplings from their confined cradles into larger vessels, a ritual of growth and nurturing that mirrored my own deepening relationship with the Earth. As an artist, my engagement with soil has been both sporadic and profound, each interaction a meditation on the earth&apos;s raw, tactile essence. The first international group exhibition I ever curated was titled Misava , which is Tsonga for Earth. Travelling over the years, I have discerned a striking pattern, which I have often thought of dismissing as aesthetic acculturation: South African artists uniquely embrace soil, weaving it into their practice and praxis more expansively than I’ve seen their global counterparts. I stand to be proven otherwise. I believe this recurring motif is a testament to its profound resonance within the South African art canon. In late 2022, I was introduced to the term ‘GeoSemantics’. The term emerged during discussions on geological writings at the Latin American Environmental Humanities Platform in March 2022. The dialogue around the forum explores how geological elements—rocks, minerals, and fossils—are finding expression in diverse artistic forms and critical discourses. Observing the emergence of a fresh geological aesthetic rooted in the socio-ecological contexts of the Global South, the platform questions the frameworks through which established ideas about matter are understood. Dineo Seshee Bopape, (Nder brick) ... in process (Harmonic Conversions), 2020, Photography: Stuart Whipps Central to the discourse were inquiries into the intersections of geological materials with art, colonial legacies, and climate justice. Could these geological urgencies forge new pathways in cultural inquiry? How might they prompt reconfigurations of our understanding of the world and its complex interconnections? These conversations aimed to unearth not only artistic possibilities but also deeper reflections on the ethical and political dimensions of geological presence and its implications for contemporary cultural and environmental discourse. My first encounter with soil in art was through Moshekwa Langa&apos;s seminal ‘drag paintings’, first showcased in his exhibition Fugitive at Stevenson in August 2017. These monumental, unstretched canvases are suffused with the rusty, sanguine hues of Limpopo&apos;s leached laterite soil. Years later, I was captivated by Dineo Seshee Bopape&apos;s (Nder brick) --- in process (Harmonic Conversions), 2020, at the Fellbach Triennale. Bopape, also a native of Limpopo, frequently employs soil in her installations, sourcing it from disparate locales to construct vast, immersive environments. These contemplative spaces invite a profound engagement with the materiality and metaphysics of soil. In Bopape&apos;s hands, the earth is a medium and a message, a bridge between disparate geographies and histories. Her installations serve as visceral conduits to the essence of place, compelling viewers to confront the intricate web of identities and belongings etched into the earth beneath our feet. Here, soil becomes not merely a substance but a potent symbol of enduring spirit, bearing witness to the ceaseless cycles of adversity and transformation that define the human experience. Over the years, I&apos;ve witnessed a growing embrace of soil as a medium by a diverse cadre of artists near and far. Among them are Xhanti Zwelendaba&apos;s early explorations, Inga Somdyala&apos;s expansive installations and refined&apos;smear’ canvases, or Nozuko Madokwe&apos;s ethereal layered canvases enriched with minerals, or more recently, Bronwyn Katz&apos;s installation Soetes, 2024 at her notably remarkable debut solo show at Stevenson titled Stone’s Envelope, a love spiral of erosion and renewal.

Courtesy of the artist and blank projects, Cape Town. © Lerato Shadi My favourite video work involving soil is staged in Lotlhakane, nestled within the dry lands of Mahikeng, Northwest Province. Lerato Shadi&apos;s 2016 video &quot;Motlhaba Wa Re Ke Namile&quot; captures a profound narrative. Here, the act of ingesting soil serves as a stark evocation—a direct reference to the masks enforced upon enslaved Africans in America. These masks, designed to prevent suicide by soil consumption, symbolise the extreme measures taken to separate individuals from their ancestral ties. Dispossessed of their native lands, enslaved Africans resorted to consuming soil in a poignant act of defiance against displacement. Shadi&apos;s portrayal mirrors this historical struggle, consuming red earth from her homeland with a blend of reluctance and determination. Each swallow is laden with significance, embodying a solemn reclamation of cultural heritage amidst tears and visceral discomfort. Her poignant performance echoes the enduring resonance of collective memory and the enduring struggle for identity and dignity. It was during a recent visit to Cape Town that Fede’s Lebo Kekana’s collaborative group exhibition &quot;iSenzo Sak&apos;dala&quot; at Reservoir brought up the idea of soil yet again. I’d describe the exhibition as a meditation on material methodologies and cultural legacies. Here, wood, soil, stone, and grass converge not as mere media but as vessels for ancestral wisdom, preserving indigenous knowledge systems. Luis M.S. Santos, On the soles of my feet, 2019, R70,000.00 excluding VAT, ENQUIRE In this gathering, Seretse Moletsane&apos;s canvases stood out—for more reasons than I can mention here —specifically their materiality—primarily soil—casting vivid, soapy, fresh colours against the earth&apos;s grounded hues. There&apos;s a tender balance in Moletsane&apos;s work, where textures and colours, reminiscent of the vivid abstractions found in colour field painting, intertwine. Amidst these contemplations, Atang Tshikare&apos;s—another artist showing in this exhibition—ethereal soil plant sculptures surfaced in my mind—a testament to the exhibition&apos;s embrace of the organic, the tactile, and the enduring conversation between culture and nature. But why does soil hold such sway in our local artistic lexicon? What binds the works of all these artists to their shared materiality? How do the local environment and landscape influence the artistic interpretation of soil as a medium? In what ways do artists navigate the balance between celebrating the earth&apos;s materiality and addressing environmental concerns in their work? How does the historical and cultural significance of soil in indigenous traditions shape contemporary artistic practices? What role does the tactile and sensory nature of soil play in conveying deeper meanings and emotions in artworks? Benjamin Stanwix, Untitled, 2024, Price on request, R30,000.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE The answers lie in soil&apos;s symbolic gravitas and tangible power, its role as a custodian of memory, identity, and resistance. Soil is the primary entity on which all terrestrial life depends. 95% of all the food consumed by humans comes from soil. Soil and life have evolved together; one can’t exist without the other. With fresh memories of our grandmothers planting our placentas in the earth and other countless burials. In the context of South Africa, soil is more than matter; it is narrative, repository, and witness. It bears the long past of Mapungubwe and great Zimbabwe and the imprints of colonisation, dispossession, and apartheid, and echoes the ongoing struggles for land restitution and social justice. For artists, soil can be a declaration of identity and rootedness. A medium through which they reclaim and reconfigure space and history. Soil is imbued with spiritual connotations, tied to ancestry, heritage, and the cyclical nature of life and death. Soil is not just a medium for growth; it is a conduit for the sacred. To touch its depths is to commune with the spirits that dwell within and to feel the heartbeat of the land itself. From its dark mysteries emerge stories of resilience and survival. In the metaphysics of African indigenous thought, soil is the silent oracle, speaking in the language of roots and leaves, inviting us to remember our interconnectedness with all living things. Seretse Moletsane, Kgoro, R48,000.00 ex. VAT, 2023, ENQUIRE In art curation, artworks speak in tongues both ancient and contemporary, weaving narratives that transcend the temporal confines of gallery walls. They summon echoes of displacement, rootedness, diaspora, and return. Here, the act of creation using soil becomes a ritual of reclamation—a homage to the resilience of cultures intertwined with the earth&apos;s heartbeat. Through their art, these visionaries excavate buried truths, excavating buried truths, and unearthing buried truths. This profound relationship with soil converges and intertwines with emergent art discourses that span food, art, and activism. It calls forth a dialogue on community nourishment, on the wisdom of plants, the secrets of seeds, the continued prevalence of extractivism across the African continent, and the ancient knowledge embedded within indigenous ethnobotany. Here, in the interstices of these themes, lies a fertile ground for exploration—a space where the tactile intimacy of soil becomes a catalyst for a deeper understanding of our connection to the earth and to each other. The continued artistic engagement with this medium mirrors the intricate layers of the nation&apos;s history and the timeless significance of its landscapes. Through the medium of soil, artists weave narratives of connection, continuity, and transformation, inviting a deep reflection on our inherent ties to the land and to each other. These works evoke a profound awareness of our shared journey, encouraging us to envision a future rooted in memory and the perpetual renewal of creative expression.</description>

      <description>Towards the end of last year a surge of interest in the stylistic elements of Jean-Michel Basquait’s paintings occurred in the more self-conscious corners of TikTok. The focus was largely directed towards what were perceived as ‘Basquiat clones’: young amateur painters, largely men, whose artworks were reminiscent of Basquiat’s neo-expressionism.</description>

      <description>The story goes like this: João Mangual was a prominent Mozambican businessman, architect and art patron who was involved in the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) in the 1960s and 70s. He was invested in the South African anti-apartheid struggle, too, and was a strong supporter of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). An eloquent speaker and a man of many languages, Mangual frequently liaised with FRELIMO members as well as Russian dignitaries, which saw him making several trips to Russia. Being both an architect and an art-lover, he had a particular interest in Modernist sculpture and began building up a collection of pieces from artists working in the style of Russian Constructivism. In 1978, after shipping a number of these works back to Mozambique, Mangual decided he wanted to showcase his collection in a public exhibition.</description>

      <title>Emerging voices turn up the HEAT on Cape Town&apos;s art scene</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/emerging-voices-turn-up-the-heat-on-cape-towns-art-scene</link>
      <description>Emerging voices turn up the HEAT on Cape Town&apos;s art scene By Mary Corrigall ------------- If you peruse the 16 art exhibitions and live programming of the HEAT Festival, you aren&apos;t likely to see the names of too many famous artists. The HEAT Winter Arts Festival was not originally tailored for young or emerging artists. This focus occurred organically - as a nascent festival, it made sense to unearth new talent, and a fresh point of view. The festival was also a result of the initial inspiration, which focused on the small to medium-sized art dealers in Cape Town&apos;s city centre. Research during an arts journalism project in 2023, which coincided with the winter season, starkly revealed the impact of the bad weather and low tourist season on foot traffic and sales. Raymond Fuyana, Dark Night, 2022, oil and acrylic on canvas, will show at Ebony/CURATED&apos;s exhibition &apos;as we see it...&apos; Is there potential for downtime in Cape Town&apos;s art market? If so how could interest and foot traffic be increased to the 16 or more art galleries in winter when even well-heeled Capetonians follow the swallows (European expats who avoid winter in both hemispheres) to Europe during this time of year? Some of the art world&apos;s innovative ideas originated from addressing downtime woes. Indeed the concept of art fairs in Europe - which started in 1967 with Art Cologne in that German city came out of a need to turn attention not only to contemporary art but to assert relevance to trading outside the economic capital - Bonn. HEAT is not an art fair - it is somewhat of a different animal in that visitors have 12 days to view art across the 16 gallery spaces that are participating which include: artHARARE, The AVA, Christopher Moller, Ebony/Curated, Eclectica Contemporary, Kalashnikovv, 99 Loop Gallery, Iziko South African National Gallery, Michaelis Galleries, Nel Gallery, Reservoir Projects, Sisonke Gallery, Under the Aegis, Hub gallery, Union House by Spier Arts Trust, Vela Projects and WORLDART. Stephen Allwright, courtesy of the artist The upside of downtime is that art dealers are willing to take some risks. Many of the participating dealers are working with artists they have not had relationships with previously and/or a younger group of artists. This is also the product of the theme set for the festival - Common Ground - by my co-curators Voni Baloyi, Andrew Lamprecht and Nkgopoleng Moloi. This concept was rooted in our interest in what conditions would bring not only our local art community together during the cold season but more broadly our society. With her thoughts on the 30 years of democracy anniversary Baloyi, the youngest on our team, was particularly interested in the tensions embedded in social cohesion - &quot;there has to be an acknowledgement of difference coupled with every individual, whether Black, Coloured, Indian, white, or Asian must feel as though they have a stake in this country, geographically, politically, and economically,&quot; she opined in The Daily Maverick . In line with this, our thinking was on the socio-political context we have birthed for the next generation. This coincided with our partnerships for the live programming with Opera UCT, who have curated a programme of operatic performances showcasing some of their top students. The jazz component, curated by Slowlife, a peripatetic jazz platform, also champions rising musicians. Dada Khanyisa - uBab&apos;omncane eThekwin ngo 87, 2024, Walnut, Jelutong, Kiaat, Greenheart, Mdf and Pine wood on painted canvas and pine ply wood How do young people position themselves in relationship to the multiple communities in South Africa and indeed in contrast to Gen X or Millenials? This question, more or less has become the lens through which the artworks on HEAT and - the other live performance works - can be read. 99 Loop gallery has tackled this idea directly presenting an exhibition of self-portraits by a range of artists - from different backgrounds and generations - that include Rory Emmett, Heidi Fourie, Paul Wallington, Stephen Allwright, Clare Menck, Nazeer Jappie, Colijn Strydom, Alexis Schofield, Robert Hamblin, Ilené Bothma, Gene Lesouw, Oda Tungodden, Olivia Botha, and Leila Abrahams. As expected their renderings are all unique, not only in their vocabularies but in how they view themselves. Bothma has characteristically, concealed her face beneath a gauze, while Menck floats in water in the distance. Jappie - a newcomer to the art scene - presents his disembodied head adjacent to a cyprus tree - which denotes mourning, death. He is fascinated by how certain well-publicised deaths in the news bind communities across the globe. Jappie is one of the interesting new voices that will demand interest in the HEAT exhibition programme. Ebony/CURATED have purposefully presented a selection of artists that exemplified a breadth of new artistic talent rising to the fore of the South African art scene in a group exhibition titled, as we see it... This has included; Thando Phenyane, Hanna Noor Mahomed, Raymond Fuyana, Sechaba Hoha, Blessing Rooi, Feni Chulumanco, Rentia Retief, Abongile Sidzumo, Aviwe Plaatjie, Balekane Legoabe, Liam Van Der Heever and Lindisipho Gulwa. Phenyane is particularly interesting. Even though he is focused on upturning the representation of the black figure, he takes an interesting path heavily influenced by Francis Bacon, though conceptually rooted in Zakes Mda&apos;s Zulus in New York . Naturally, some young artists whose work stood out at the RMB Latitudes are rising to the top of the HEAT Festival. Such as Van der Heever - with his vivid surreal pop paintings - and Charity Vilakazi who will show a suite of paintings under the title, Alikho izulu? (Is there no heaven?), at Kalashnikovv&apos;s newly opened Cape Town gallery, in which she channels her grief after her grandmother&apos;s passing but also her connection to her and other ancestors which is sustained beyond the naked eye. Treasure Mlima, who caught my attention for the first time at RMB Latitudes, is also interested in using his art to remain connected to his ancestors. This doesn&apos;t manifest directly in the content of the works he has produced for an exhibition at Reservoir curated by Lebo Kekana, fittingly titled: Indlela ibuzwa kwaba phambili. (Direction is sought from those who have come before (are ahead.) Kekana, who also shaped parts of RMB Latitudes programming, may be twenty-three but he is carving out a name for himself, not only as the director of FEDE, but at the HEAT Festival. His exhibition at Reservoir is thoughtful, centred on how materials - particularly wood have influenced the expression of a new generation of artists. Mlima spiritually communes with his ancestors while making his art, made from carving wood into flat picture frames. In this way, the community that he feels most connected to is the one that is no longer living in the physical realm. &quot;That&apos;s a community that I look towards and try to bring alive, by creating the medium between our physical realm and their ancestral. It&apos;s (my way) of thanking them for carrying me this far,&quot; says Mlima. Ferai Engelbrecht&apos;s Mavambo, Saviour Syndrome, Chalk pastel, charcoal and Japanese ink on Fabriano paper. Is part of artHARARE&apos;s &apos;Mavambo&apos; (the Beginning) exhibition. What is particularly striking about the exhibitions - and the theatre programme - is the strong LBTQI slant - or the &apos;Queering of the world&quot; as one commentator put it. Undoubtedly, artists are more open about exploring their sexuality. The theatre programme features several non-binary and queer performers - from Pichi Keane - a non-binary drag queen to Andi Colombo, Aldo Brincat and others, addressing the vagaries of their daily lives, and histories. Love, the search for it and sustaining it is at the heart of these stories. Nel gallery presents a collection of photographic works at Pride and Prejudice by Toscaneena, a queer art duo consisting of Tosca Marthinus and Neena Borrill, who represent their love depicted through the intertwining of their bodies through black and white photographic works. Desire Marea&apos;s exhibition of paintings of Zulu warriors in love on the battlefield of Islandwana, Baddies of Isandlwana, showing at Eceletica Contemporary is attracting attention. Not only because Marea is a well-known international musician and performer but the unexpected, yet endearing love scenes he presents that challenge Zulu machismo and history. &quot;Putting your life on the line (in a battle) or being in defence of something is romantic... I was also thinking about what they were fighting against - the British,&quot; says Marea. Ultimately, Marea suggests that while the queer communities have had to unite to gain acceptance and to be acknowledged for their contribution to wider communities, &quot;the end goal is to integrate ourselves.&quot; Blurring the hard lines between identities has surfaced through a number of shows, particularly those which include artists from other African countries such as Christopher Moller’s Transcending Boundaries , which include works by Abalade Glover to Olamide Ogunde. Promoting the art of Zimbabwean artists is, of course, the focus of artHARARE’s debut show at their new Bree Street gallery, though it demonstrates through a range of works by Farai Englebrecht, Tafadzwa Gwetai, Anusa Salanje, Sindiso Nyoni, Nicky Mariga, Richard Mudariki, Mostaff Muchawaya and Dan Halter, that geographical positions might be the source of connection but don’t’ always translate into a united worldview.

      <title>Critical Friend</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/critical-friend</link>
      <description>Critical Friend - by Ashraf Jamal DESDEMONA: What wouldst thou write to me, If thou shouldst praise me? IAGO: O gentle lady, do not put me to ‘t, For I am nothing if not critical. – William Shakespeare, Othello ---------------- For my last birthday I was gifted a black jacket from the c77 series made in Lesotho by the industrial workwear company, Johnson. The Cape Town based A4 Arts Foundation logo was modestly embroidered on the front in cerulean blue while immodestly on the back, in glittering bold blue, the words read – Critical Friend. For someone not given to dressing up it has become my go-to jacket for any art related function, in this case the 2024 RMB Latitudes Art Fair where, on behalf of the Doha based ARAK Collection, I ran a workshop on art writing. In February the first workshop was run in Windhoek, Namibia. Johannesburg followed in May. Up next are workshops in Kampala and Lagos. The objective? To introduce young African minds to the matter of writing about art, a task scantily grasped, perfunctorily expressed, hobbled by sycophantic commentary, enamoured by its newly sanctified object – the contemporary African art work – which over the past decade has assumed a global centrality as a newfangled art commodity and fetish. In the haste to canonise the contemporary African artist – as well as artists of the African diaspora – it has largely fallen to writers outside of the continent to stake their claim. This strategy is unsurprising, given its extractive colonial precedent. In saying this, I by no means endorse the dichotomy of the indigenous and exogenous, inner and outer realms, preferring to recognise the fact that all continents and cultures are interfused, despite claims to the contrary. That cultures are intrinsically hybrid and essentialism, a dogmatic and dangerous cult, the ruse of those who seek to oppressively maintain cultural-historical differences. It is the interpenetrative nature of life, the fact that art is the sum of globalised contaminants, which allows me to refute provincial and continental divides. It is true that African art is distinctive. This is not because it is peculiarly ‘African’, but because it is intensively responsive to the fallout of slavery, indenture, Empire – matters that persist today. However, against the impunity of ongoing exploitation and gross disregard for the rich complexity of the continent, Africa remains profoundly counter-intuitive and immensely capable of confounding prejudice, presumption, hatred and stupidity. It is unsurprising, therefore, that African visual art should assume such an acute presence in the global art market. While other continents founder, trapped in the parochial, or the edification of their own hubris, African artists have provided a unique combination of the local and global, in effect producing deftly sutured contrasts, anomalies, perversions, perplexities. Dubbed innovative because of its ability to reimagine the global waste thrown into its dumpsites, African artists have both literally and imaginatively converted that perceived waste – a bale of used garments, a mountain of defunct computers – as the sources of novel reconversions. Because, in a capitalist world tone deaf to its excesses, it has largely proved to be Africa which has heeded the desperation concealed beneath beguiling power and immoral greed. That the great South African leader, Steve Bantu Biko, declared that it would be Africa that would give the world a ‘human face’, speaks to the tragic absence of global humanity, or, rather, the greater need to restore its failing humanity. It is within this troubling context that the ARAK Collection, with the support of the RMB Latitudes Art Fair, ran its second art writing workshop. The objective was never prescriptive. However, after the celebrated New York based art critic, Roberta Smith, one vital rejoinder and wager was proposed – that “Criticism isn’t really an academic subject. I don’t think it can be taught at school; its much more visceral. It happens when you’re in front of art, examining it, articulating opinions and trying to convert those opinions into clear prose”. If Smith’s view is salutary, it is because we are facing a global dumbing down of intuitive complexity. Of course, Smith is being provocative. After all, criticism is integral to the Social Sciences and Humanities programmes in universities worldwide. However, it should also be said that it is precisely the reflexive critical faculty which has been rooted out, the discourse defined by collective opinion. If dogma is dangerous, it is all the more so in a time when one of the greatest civilizational achievements – democracy – is under threat everywhere. How can one think critically in an ethos that negates context, compassion, complexity, singularity, difference? How does one remain a ‘Critical Friend’? In the epigraph to his wittily aggressive collection of essays, Nothing If Not Critical, the Australian art critic, Robert Hughes, reminds us that vanity must not be borne, let alone humoured. Praise, always, must be tempered. Criticality understood as a necessary form of invasive surgery. How else will we override the dulling praise-song to the contemporary art world everywhere? If criticality matters, it is because it allows for productive difficulty. This, certainly, was the objective of the Arak workshop’s Johannesburg iteration. Located in situ, in an art fair, students were expected to engage with the artworks, dealerships, culture, people, and setting – a sprawling faux classical stone mansion with boundless nooks and crannies, winding paths, restorative fountains, and soothing green and fishy ponds. Conducted over three days – between 10am and 5pm – the process was both intensive and compassionate, for it was never my aim to impose any punitive law. Rather, through vocal interaction, healthy mutuality, site specific contemplation, the objective was to nurture the peculiarity of each writer – be it one who could not ignore the privileged nature of the contemporary African art world, another wholly drawn to a particular artist’s inspirational embrace of black African womanhood, or yet another struck by the digital frontier and Africa’s centrality therein, because of its greater youth market and boundless entrepreneurial capacity, despite the ongoing prejudice directed towards Africa’s supposed failure in this sphere. Business too must alter, as must the digital realm. And who finally truly knows what Africa can offer the world? Indeed, the rapaciously avid interest in Africa today – beyond its immense mineral and human resources – is a sure indicator that the world is well aware that there can be no future without Africa – its origin and its final frontier. Ex Africa semper quid novi … From Africa always comes something new. This ancient proverb remains true today. If it serves to embolden the young African art writers it is because it remains an enduring reminder that commentary is secondary to vision, that insight might become widely recognised, but that it is singularly honed. That dogma and prejudice are not only presumptive but profoundly dangerous. That open-endedness is not a sign of failure but a humane and generous act. That wonder overrides knowledge, and grace remains the mark of a fine writer, no matter how despairing or virulent the argument. And that what we all need, in this benighted and immoral hour, is a critical friend.</description>

      <title>Strangeness and Charm</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/strangeness-and-charm</link>
      <description>Strangeness and Charm By Donatella du Plessis ----------- “The beautiful is always bizarre,” says Baudelaire in his Curiosités esthétiques. “I do not mean that it should be deliberately, coldly bizarre, for in this case it would be a monster gone off the rails of life.” While this year’s RMB Latitudes Art Fair went ahead without any overt insanity of the kind that Baudelaire describes, many of the works on display exemplified the strangeness and charm of the beautiful bizarre in a venue so splendidly unorthodox that one might be forgiven for thinking it was designed for the very purpose. Balekane Legoabe, field day 8/9, 2024, variable colour etching with unique drawn element, 77x56,5cm, CONTACT TO BUY Some of the most striking strangeness to be found at the fair were Dominic Pretorius’ three glass funerary urns, presented by Vela Projects. Notwithstanding the enthralling grotesqueness of the urns’ ceramic human inhabitants, the works are also mounted in aluminium light boxes, the stark white glow making them seem all the more strange and otherworldly. Each of Pretorius’ light boxes has been named for a line from Inferno , the first part of Dante Alighieri&apos;s The Divine Comedy , and while the connection to the grandeur of that work is no disadvantage, Pretorius’ approach to it is both refreshing and original. Rather than presenting the viewer with the highlights package of the circles of hell so common in popular culture, Pretorius is inspired by the first three canti of the Inferno ; the wandering in a dark wood and the descent to the gate of hell. In ‘Through me you go to the grief-racked city’, the viewer is met with a wall of terrified faces. The souls waiting at the gate of hell are reduced to identical heads and shoulders, packed together like a chaotic, writhing catacomb wall, eyes and mouths wide open, the clay cracking and fragmented. The sense of claustrophobia is only augmented by the startling presentation of these faces inside a glass urn: locked in, imprisoned in a lake of baked clay. With the light box a cruel spotlight on their inability to escape, the work is a visceral portrayal of the horrors of liminality. What lies beyond the gate is hideous, but the act of waiting for it, imagining it, with the words “Through me you go to the grief-wrecked city” inscribed above, is a torture that can only be relieved by entering hell itself. Pretorius, unlike Dante, is merciless in this regard. Dominic Pretorius, Down where the sun is mute II, R40,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Balekane Legoabe’s captivating series of etchings and monotypes (presented by Eleven Editions) are far closer to the charming end of what we might call the strangeness and charm spectrum. Liminality and the experiences of the living things that pass through it are a central concern for Legoabe, and the influence of San Rock Art in her work imbues it with the primal energy of caves, some of the oldest liminal spaces in existence. In ‘Field Day 8/9’ , a rectangular sheet of pristine paper serves as a cave wall. It is dominated by an etching of a tranquil, pale blue square swirling with meticulously detailed earthen pathways. This square gives form to the otherworldly creatures that exist on the surface of the cave wall. The animals, all presented in profile in the manner of San Rock Art, are like characters from a half-remembered dream or sketches from the notebook of an impish archeologist. Dogs with five legs and foxes with three – or the other way round, or neither – frolic alongside birds and goats that have no visible legs at all, their bottom halves enrobed in what look like little dresses or miniature caparisons. The effect is riotous and fantastical, but playful at the same time. Indeed, if one considers ‘Field Day 8/9’ in the context of cave art, it is hard to avoid reimagining this whimsical work as part of the Cradle of Humankind, enchanting all the people that move through the caves over the centuries. Beneath the blue square and its menagerie of charming beasts is a blue whale. It is clearly outside the borders of the square, but measures exactly the same length, with a line etched directly beneath the whale as though to emphasise its existence above and apart from the rest of the world. The world’s largest mammal, the blue whale rules the ocean and the element of water, which with all its attendant symbolism of transcendence, death and rebirth, is an archetypal liminal space of which the whale is the ultimate representation. Thus, Legoabe portrays two grand forces of nature and liminality (Earth and Water) in a way that is both unusual and delightful, typifying the beauty of the bizarre and unconventional. Of all the artworks at the fair, strangeness and charm are both deployed to luminous effect in Anico Mostert’s painting ‘Moon Shadows’ (oil on board, presented by Ebony/Curated). White light shines from an incandescent moon, spiralling through the indigo expanse like soundwaves. Below is a green planet, bathed in moonlight. On the surface, four faceless, elongated figures stop to listen. None of them is craning their heads to the sky, and yet they seem to be rendered larger by whatever it is that they hear. The facelessness of Mostert’s figures gives a touching universality to this communal act of listening. The moonlight and the moon music create a conduit, an in-between space, in which humanity can achieve and be enriched by a transcendent connection with the divine, or nature, or whichever primal forces shape our lives here on earth. Anico Mostert, Moon Shadows, 2023 An important part of what makes Mostert’s work so enthralling is her use of colour. In art, communion with the divine can and has been portrayed in countless, exceedingly traditional ways, many involving blood red, snow white, gold leaf, ultramarine blue or ascetic brown and black. Mostert, however, has clad her figures in robes of pale pink, that most feminine and whimsical of colours, thus bringing a sense of modernity, gentleness and love to an age-old subject that is all too often clouded by fear. The contrast of the pink robes with the dark drama of the background creates a scene of uncanny, resplendent magic. Anico Mostert, Swim, 2023, Price on request, CONTACT TO BUY Observing these portrayals of liminal worlds in a place like Shepstone Gardens, where moving from Renaissance Italy to Ottoman Turkey is possible by climbing a flight of stairs, crossing a pool or dodging the odd gorgoneion, is bizarre in itself. One rushes from one solid-seeming universe to another, drunk on splendour and whimsy. Then, the uncanny sets in, and one is seized by feelings of being between one place and another, unable to go forwards or backwards no matter how much one moves. The artworks and the venue work together to immerse the viewer in a remarkable, liminal world, and the experience is extraordinary.

      <title>Beyond Function: The Persistence of Clay</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/beyond-function-the-persistence-of-clay</link>
      <description>Beyond Function: The Persistence of Clay - By Dineo Ponde ----------- In May of 2024, the annual RMB Latitudes Art Fair was held at Shepstone Gardens, in Johannesburg’s Houghton. Amid a magnificent garden, the fair was positioned almost as an open cathedral, resembling Romanesque-inspired architecture. It felt like a spectacle for the bourgeoisie. While walking through the maze I saw the expected. The usual abstractedly configured paintings, Gail Catlin’s painted dogs and Guy du Toit’s Hares were scattered around the garden. There were some sculptural iterations of the Madonna and child (except make it Africa and out of bronze). Black portraiture, in its different modalities and of course the favourable black modernist South African relics; Gerald Sekoto and George Pemba. I chucked as I walked past a Jacobus Pierneef painting. While this was all very admirable, I was craving something a little more tangible. This drew me to the tactility of the clay works on exhibition – an essential moment of grounding in an oversaturated visual environment. Siyabonga Fani, Dudlu, 2024, R48,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Earthing, also known as grounding, helps balance and connect our bodies to the earth’s electromagnetic field through our electrons. Walking barefoot, and gardening are great examples of these. Ancient civilisations from the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans and Indigenous cultures have used this technique. This is appealing because it highlights human beings’ dependent and vital connection to the Earth and the material it emits, such as clay. Caitlin Macdonald echoes something similar in Clay Formes (an Art Formes publication) expressing that clay predates human civilisation, in our use of its organic form as a life force: “We have constructed shelters, vessels for food and water, made idols, art objects, vases, currencies, talismans, funerary urns and inscribed laws and myths upon clays surface”. Clay is deeply versatile, and yet it is often appreciated for what it can do as opposed to what it allows us to feel, decipher and understand beyond its utilitarian function. It appears we need clay works because of their ancient and timeless familiarity. I sought after artists whose works were vastly different, in appearance and subject matter but were held together by their use of clay works beyond its practicality. Artists Siyabonga Fani, Dominic Pretorius and Nicola Smith create a different syntax using such simple yet malleable materials. Clay’s ability, as expressed in Clay Formes , is “to change, to lumber towards the future, clay forms wax and wane; they are capable of great frailty and recovery”. Clays’ capability to morph and shapeshift holds so many dualities, it is both soft and sturdy (once fired), elastic and fixed, and it is difficult to think of it as a one-set thing. Present in the exhibition booth Art Formes (initiated by its founder Olivia Barrell), were Fani’s, organic, bodily clay vessels standing tall and wide. Fani’s terracotta clay is burnished once semi-dry, then smoke-fired to create a burned brown colour. I was amazed at how the vessel&apos;s small base was able to carry its overarching weight. They feel as though they are collapsing and expanding into each other. On them are bends, grooves and reliefs that mimic woodcuts but are stretched-out clay. I can’t help but wonder if the textural difference reflects the contours in landscapes due to the meandering aspect of his work, which mirrors hills, rivers and valleys. Barrell comments on how Fani’s use of clay, beyond its conventional representations of clay pots or natural landscapes, challenges an imperialist monolithic portrayal of African ceramics altogether. His work brings to the fold fuller, and more nuanced narratives. Fani’s work is informed by his experience living in Gugulethu township, as opposed to a homeland in the Eastern Cape both speak to the “legacies of Apartheid-era spatial planning”, it is no doubt this still plagues South African society today. Fani’s work allows Clay to be conceptual as it is materially dynamic. Then there are the clay works of Pretorius, who exhibited with the up-and-coming Cape Town Gallery, Vela Projects. His work reads as excavated archaeological ruins, more than shrined Urns. They are too mystical, too frail to have once held the ashes of a deceased one, even in its original historical timeframe. Urns, in general, are unsettling because of their association with loss and grief and the unanswerable question around an afterlife make you shiver. Still, despite what they represent, they also hold an ephemeral sacredness to them, that makes them so deeply beautiful. Peculiar, is it not? That what we make to hold our dead will one day hold us. Pretorius expresses how his Urns are not time-nor-site bound, that they do not belong to one physical realm but rather can be considered as an “archaeology of myth”. The main question that surrounding this body of work is “What do urns contain, symbolically speaking?” Dominic Pretorius, Through me you go to the grief-racked city, R40,000.00 ex. vat, CONTACT TO BUY The titles provided another entry point into the work, referencing 14th-century Italian writer Dante Alighieri’s narrative poem; The Divine Comedy , in three parts; Inferno, Purgatorio (Purgatory) and Paradiso (Paradise). Perhaps he references this for its linguistical prose, nonetheless, an allegory is told. A figure falling from grace into a bellowing abyss in; ‘Down where the sun is mute’ (2024) is unable to decipher who will be there to catch their fall. Pretorius’, aluminium lit (almost tryptic-like) lightboxes, read as a nonchronological parable. The fallen figure continues into the next; ‘Awash in the lake of my heart’ (2024). Present are three witnesses, and below them, two lovers in a distant embrace. ‘Through me you go to the grief-racked city’ (2024) is the last of the three artworks, though it does not feel like an ending, maybe a type of beginning (depending on how you look at it). Delicate specters/souls are present in all three works calling out to you while calling you in. Pretorius’ shrined Urns capture the cyclical nature of existence, by blurring the lines between life and death, in his own words: “The firing process is about both birth and death. The kiln is similar to furnaces in which bodies are cremated and turned to ash. And yet, the kiln is also a place of gestation and transformation like a womb. Raw clay enters the kiln and is birthed as a ceramic urn. This newly born vessel then carries the remains of the dead. This, for me, captures the non-dualism of birth and death: they are the same threshold, they contain each other”. Nicola Smith, Text-til e, 2024 As I manoeuvred through the maze I stumbled across Smith’s work, in the booth Claysense. She beautifully captures the meditative process of working with clay. Playfully, Smith fashions a language of care through ritualistic repetition. Her work ‘Text-tile’ (2024) depicts a conglomeration of six hundred and fifty “hand cut, carved and finished tiles” in a variety of rusts, creams and teal tints bound together with recycled climbing rope. There’s a serenity brought about by repetition. Repetition in wedging the clay, in making identical segments and piecing them together. Facing ‘Text-tile’ it looks like a pixilated tapestry but from a bird’s eye view, it reads as a type of landscape. Textile refers to “any material made of interlacing fibres including carpeting and geotextiles”. Whimsically, Smith considers this by creating a tapestry-almost-blanket looking like piece, out of quite contradictory material. I think of wearing it as a blanket, it would do the opposite of what it&apos;s intended, it would be hard and cold. Smith&apos;s work is warm and inviting (maybe that’s why I associate it with a blanket). Although I could not stretch out my hand and touch it, I enjoyed that I desired to. Clay, unlike textiles, goes through a firing process. Unfired clay is soft and malleable, after being fired it dries hard, and can break (and often does as any ceramist would tell you). For me, Smith&apos;s works bring into question our relationship with mundane objects and what they can do for us. Smith’s work in a similar way reminds me of Swiss surrealist artist, Méret Oppenheim’s 1936 Le Déjuener en Fourrure (Luncheon in fur), not because of its visceral absurdity, but, in the words of Oppenheim herself because it is “not an illustration of an idea, but the thing itself”. The similarity in all these artists&apos; work was that they allowed the clay to just be “the thing itself” they encouraged it to transcend its practicality, they handled it in its enduring and dynamic nature, they explored its time-based and process-driven element, it pulled them in, and they let it. Their clay works ask them to use their whole selves “shaping the medium and being shaped by it over time”. In this way, the clay persists.

      <description>Pathmaking and placemaking at the RMB Latitudes Art Fair - By Xanthe Scout Lardner-Burke ------------- A garden is a clever choice for a fair branding itself as emergent and fresh-faced. Clever, in the sense that gardens are emergent and disclosing. As a living space, they ask for a conspiratory cohabitation, an acknowledgment that space-making is a collaborative exercise. Today the Gardens are tranquil, as I sit writing, a tiered water feature streams into a pool. Children crowd the base of the pool. ‘It must be magical to be a child here’ I think. Indeed, it is not sterile in the language we have come to associate with art fairs. Not sterile in white walls, or booths that line up consecutively. Aperol Spritz stands pepper the fair, and people lounge on manicured lawns. Even in its busyness, it is lazy, easy, languid. As I watch, a woman gestures to a chapel-like structure of specially imported sandstone, used to make an imitative structure less imitative. She is saying, “Yes that is our Bridal suite” to an old lady, who is saying “Oh how wonderful”. At Latitudes I am acutely aware of the straddling of space – and time. It takes me a while to get my bearings. The tiered landscape and the odd buildings are ahistorical amalgamations without reference to time or place. As such, the landscape and structures seem to maze in on each other. Buildings share a syntax of appropriated approximations that make entrance and exit disorientating. This is exasperated by pathways that connect them haphazardly. The fair is situated across various structures – Mezzanine, Glass Marquee, Centre Court &amp; Chapel to name a few. The programme describes the different spaces as hubs – “each of which showcases contemporary art galleries and exhibitions from across the continent”. More than centering activity, these spaces demand movement to and fro. The tiered garden and double-volume buildings offer a variance to the way viewers see artwork. A marquee with a glass roof near the entrance makes for a clear view of the sky. Light trickles in and casts a shadow on Lucinda Mudge’s ‘Combat’ (2020). Shadow grants the work a depth, a place in a field of vision that allows one to measure proximity. I am thinking of how paintings shift and change colour under fluorescent, everyday indoor light. That light is sanitising, wiping a surface clean. Cleanliness suffers an artwork’s ability to take on space – cast shadow, bounce light, hold it. Remove the roof of the white cube, grub the senses, and suddenly the work can take on shape that demands reciprocity; an awareness of one&apos;s own body in relation to the work. Lucinda Mudge, Combat, 2020, CONTACT TO BUY The estate is available to the public for perusal during Open Gardens and privately, for venue hire. Art Fairs are so often considered events unto themselves. Appearing suddenly, as if by mirage, and disappearing as quickly as they appeared. There are no leading lines, beyond the apparition of the event, which seemingly produces itself. Shepstone Gardens lends the fair a shadow, some meatiness – or better, a worldliness – that gives the fair context. That produces something quite different. I am reminded of driving through Joburg for the first time, looking for jacarandas, shocked by the sheer monumentality of sprawling, high-walled suburbs. Steadily this wealth has been worn down, the shiniest pockets of the city frayed. Here, now, the estate feels nostalgic for that opulent whimsy – clandestine wealth. What does it mean to share in wealth like this? To access it, as we do here, fleetingly? Something is disquieting in the green space of the garden. It is true, that the garden may exist in a public memory repository beyond the fair. You may return to it, fixed as it is in sandstone and mortar and green. It is no mirage. And yet, I am aware that I am close to something private; intruding. Access itself is fleeting here, imbibed with time, and a proximity that one knows has been granted. Art Fairs offer pathways of access to artists, exhibitors, and viewers – placemaking in an industry that so often hoards access. Latitudes serves to meet-you-half-way – to posit emergent work and spaces. Tim Ingold describes placemaking through path-making as “to be a place, every somewhere must lie on one or several paths of movement to and from places elsewhere”. Place-making is easier with people then, and lots of them. And it’s better on tiered ground. I settle at Occupying the Gallery (OTG), which has a curved end-space at the ‘Rooftop’ section of the fair. I have climbed several winding flights of stairs to stumble upon it. At the ‘rooftop’ booths are open plan and run into each other, undivided except for a floating wall at OTG’s end-space. One can enter OTG on either side of the middle, floating wall, enabling a fluidity of movement and a muddling of entrance and access. Suspended from the tip-top of the booth walls, on the aforementioned sides, are rolls of brown paper. The paper curls at the point it meets the floor. Framed prints have been hung over the flank of this brown, sleek but scrappy surface. Annotations in many coloured pens and markers are written below and beside the prints. Various handwriting makes for a collaborative framework. The surfaces of the installation foreground a sense of construction - alteration, annotation, and temporality. It is an easy legend to the uncertainty and discrete nature of studio space and practice. On the internal side of the floating wall and opposite it, in a sort of vestibule enclave framed by a hodgepodge of ionic orders, are buttery wooden crates with an array of contemporary art books and individually wrapped prints. The display of these books and packaged prints is neat, and shopfront-like. In this way, the occupation functions as a middle space, a meeting space, between a shopfront and a studio. Much like a fair. Exit through the Gift Shop is the third edition of Occupying the Gallery’s ongoing project, and riffs off Banksy’s popular documentary of the same name. The documentary/mockumentary points to a hierarchy of access and value, in reference to the weird practice whereby one exits a museum through a gift shop. Tracking value and access as they are abstracted in the museum, and gain tactility as they exit – disseminated from art objects to art paraphernalia. At this edition of the initiative book works and artworks are posited similarly, tilted only by the singularity of a frame hung at eye height in the centre of a wall. There is a flatness to this, a two-dimensionality, that the brown paper, with its handwritten notes, wears in. This paper accounts for some foreshortening – extending space and time. Books do something similar. They offer long-form engagement, more than any passer-by could digest in a single sitting, in a three-day fair. OTG is generous then, offering multiple points of access. And time for engagement beyond a single duration. This project, founded by Mary Sibande and Lawrence Lemaoana is, as Lemaoana explains, “steeped in mentorship”. Founders attempt to construct pathways for young artists. The materials used are both abstract and tactile and situated in community, and collaboration, in what can be lent, borrowed, or inferred. Lemaoana and Sibande fund materials. Sibande lets artists use her studio. Much of the third edition’s group works there together and support is offered through this community. Magaisa, a writer and artist in the third edition says, “Essentially we are always together except on weekends or for doing other projects other than Occupying the Gallery”. Curatorially, the proximity of long-form bookworks close to artworks lends canon to emerging artists. They rub off on them. Similarly, Sibande and Lemoana’s status as well-known practitioners softens the barriers to entry, and in turn, the social hierarchy of fairs. The artworks at the fair, though distinct, share a timbre. The use of print media, lack of varied sizing, and the brown paper backing unify the artist’s work. Therefore, work is less distinguishable. Artists&apos; voices are collectivised, as a distinctive authorial voice is abstracted. Founders model collaboration. In each edition Occupying the Gallery works with a print studio. For Latitudes, it is Artist Proof Studios. Working in print is a means to offer fiscal support for artists to sustain their lives and practices. Treating the work – the focus of the work – as long-form, ongoing, and in-motion. Kim Gurney describes the “agential capacity for contemporary art to not only represent but also instantiate new realities” or “in short: for doing things with art”. Collaboration is a means to establish pathways that the artists may return to of their own accord – the fair, the print studio. Mentorship models place-making while busying itself with path-making. Indeed, Occupying the Gallery is not only simply constructing trajectories, but establishing a place-making that is tactile, long-term, and closely tied to their artists&apos; lives. Tatenda Magaisa, to whom do we bequeath our bones? (detail), 2023, R13,500.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Returning to the gardens, I begin again scanning for a promising walkway. The estate is not ‘bigger’ from the various developments it has undergone. It simply has more paths and requires more movement.

      <description>Three afternoons at Latitudes: A Study on Buqaqawuli Nobakada and Kaleab Abate - By Dumisani Mnisi “A work of art encountered as a work of art is an experience, not a statement or an answer to a question.” Well then Dumisani, what are you doing, girl? Kaleab Abate, Something to gaze at nothing more, 2023, R 29,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY -------------- These words by my favourite critic, Susan Sontag, echoed in my mind as I entered the mythical world of Shepstone Gardens on day two of the RMB Latitude Art Fair in Johannesburg. With a hot cup of Mocha, I allowed the glamour and grandeur of the previous day to wear off. The first day of the fair was disorientating. It was my first time at Shepstone Gardens. I was dazed by the grand halls, marble floors, the Herbert Baker architecture and how it all seamlessly complemented the opulent gardens. The people were just as lush, clinking their champagne glasses and smiling with their eyes. For a moment, the performativity of it all deflected the motive of why I am fond of such spaces: the art! Once I grasped the duality of the environment as a work of art in itself, the intention behind where the pieces are placed and how it influences communication with the art – I felt present and aligned. Firstly, I was intrigued by the dialogue that happened between the art and where it is positioned at the fair, a comment on the structures and the unspoken echelons of the art business. The prolific Nelson Makamo pieces sitting at the Rooftop Pavilion, untitled, daring you with its price tag, question its magnitude, perched by the textile arts from Lulama Wolf, Ditiro Mashio and Reneé Rossouw. Just next door in the mezzanine, Bambo Sibiya foreshadowed his anticipated solo exhibition Ngema Kokuqubuka – After Precarity &apos; with his explosive work, ‘Jabu Shoulders’ (2024), a compelling painting that stopped me in my tracks. For me, it was the face – the precision and detail in the round nose and full lips, the straight-up hairstyle and golden hoop earrings – the familiarity and resemblance to myself and the women in my life. I was in awe. The painting looked like a photo I would find in one of the albums my grandmother stores under her bed. It reminded me of that one aunt in my family whose cooking always had me licking the plate and asking for seconds. It conjured home. Sibiya’s use of patterns, vibrant colours and the regality in the garment is reminiscent of the dutch wax fabric in Yinka Shonibare’s work. I was fascinated by Sibiya’s eloquence in creating a space of critique and celebration. As I made my way through the Centre Court of the fair, digesting the different booths and familiarising myself with the artists and galleries, I was summoned by the work of Buqaqawuli Thamani Nobakada. The resonance of her name was no coincidence. “Buqaqawuli” – which in Xhosa translates to “glory” or “to illuminate” is affirmed in her art. Regality is the theme of her work. Buqaqawuli Nobakada&apos;s work featured with Under the Aegis at RMB Latitudes 2024, photography by Anthea Pokroy Before I could investigate further on the title of the work, I was captivated by the medium – the texture of the material used denotes luxury and softness. Nobakada layers her canvas with lace fabric creating a multidimensional surface for her subjects. The floral lace patterns embedded in her art act as a lens and manual on how to navigate femininity in her work. This softness translates in her colour pallet as well, using warm hues of browns, pastel pinks and yellows, rich greens and blues, she implores grace and regality on the Black femme subject. ‘Olympia (1863) giving herself flowers: A Reverence for Self Adoration’ (2024) alludes to French painter Edouard Manet’s controversial piece ‘Olympia’ (1863). Manet’s painting created discourse by tainting Venus, unravelling the mythical, goddess narrative attached to the female body. The outrage towards ‘Olympia’ – the verisimilitude in her body, the lack of passiveness in her gaze, her black maid handing her flowers as a form of payment framing Olympia as a prostitute – disturbed the representation of woman as a passive material. It opened up new discourse which fueled the first and second wave of feminism allowing women to be active subjects beyond art. Buqaqawuli Nobakada&apos;s work featured with Under the Aegis at RMB Latitudes 2024, photography by Anthea Pokroy By portraying Olympia as a black woman, Nobakada acknowledges the erasure of the Black woman as multidimensional in both art and history. She uses this iconic painting and brings it back to contemporary times. Her work is an ode to censored figures like Sarah Baartman who was labelled the “Hottentot Venus”, packaged and shipped around the world – her personal essence and integrity reduced by this “otherness”. This otherness that I have personally experienced when I travel outside of South Africa to this day. The bouquet of flowers in Nobakada&apos;s ‘Olympia’ are a peace offering to all the misperceptions and nonconsensual discourse framed around Black women. The delicacy and softness in her technique subverts the tension and allows us to see ourselves as the delicate complex beings who do not need to be categorised to have value. Who can just be beautiful, sexy and cool without the “buts” and “ands”. I found it fitting that Nobakada is presented by Under the Aegis, founded by Anelisa Mangcu, a young black woman creating a space that focuses on the intersectionality in African identity. Kaleab Abate’s ‘Statues with no sculptors’ (2023) evoked more questions than answers. Whose faces are these? Where are the rest of their bodies? There is chaos and distress to the piece that requires unravelling. At first glance it looks like a distorted collage – a layering of cutouts and printouts of nine black heads pasted on European plinths caged in colourful frames. But as you move closer, the work is a flat monotype print. I was intrigued by Abate&apos;s technique, the ability to mix mediums, creating depth through paint and drawing then reducing it to a flat finish demonstrating the helplessness and defeat of his subjects. As I moved closer, inspecting each frame I noticed that each face is young and fatigued and the more I observed, I realised I’ve felt the same way more often than I would like to admit. Kaleab Abate, It&apos;s not meant to be joyous, 2024, R 57,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY The youth in Abate’s faces demonstrate the feelings echoed across the continent – a yearning for more and a disinterest in mediocrity. The confrontation in some faces, while others look away in disdain or boredom serves as a defiance to the state of affairs in Africa and the rest of the world. Statues are symbols of meaning. They are created to commemorate heroes, to carry histories and preserve culture. The placement of black statue heads on plinths is ambiguous, it connotes how the events of the time – the displacement of people has irreversible consequences while the bursts of colour in the background suggest hope. The title of the piece is just as haunting. A statue with no sculptor means an artwork with no creator, a child with no parent, a generation with no direction and no guidance. This is dangerous. Abate’s work is ground to unpack all the issues the media has become oblivious to. He uses these opulent ‘safe’ spaces, wherever his work might land next – Latitudes, MoMA or the Louvre even – as a podium to announce the unfathomable truths and questions: People are dying, what are we doing about it?

      <title>Art after Instagram</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/art-after-instagram</link>
      <description>Art After Instagram - by Timothy Gawaya THE SPIRITS OF THE PUMPKINS DESCENDED INTO THE HEAVENS by Yayoi Kusama. 2015. Still taken from the artist&apos;s Instagram. Courtesy Yayoi Kusama and Ota Fine Arts. Andy Warhol’s prescient declaration, that in the future everyone would achieve a fifteen-minute fame, is important for two reasons: firstly, because he anticipated more efficient information and communication networks which would render everyone and everything everywhere all at once; secondly, because Warhol foresaw that as digital technologies exerted greater influence in our daily lives, our consciousnesses would become so overburdened by excess to the point of a complete rupture in attention. A more accurate evaluation, taking into account the complete overhaul of our critical sensibilities in light of TikTok, Instagram and our insatiable thirst for dopamine, would read thus: In the future, everything is world famous for fifteen seconds. Perhaps the great concern for art in this century, something clearly articulated by Warhol decades earlier, is relevance: staying afloat amid the noise of (post)modernity. The contemporary moment is marked by a peculiar relationship to time, in which the ubiquity of events and the speed with which they flutter in and out of existence, assisted by totalising digital infrastructures, is greatly accelerated. With the compression of temporal modes emerges a diminished capacity to hold attention in addition to its countereffect: novelty as a means of establishing relevance. Everything must be made anew; digital networks thrive on the production and cannibalisation of novelty. Yet art’s concern with relevance is perhaps a recent state of affairs. As it were, for the greater part of art history the relevance of art was rarely under question given its service to the Church and nobility: Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael, to state some famous examples, were all kept employed by the Catholic church. Questioning the relevance of art was tantamount to questioning the parameters of theistic belief itself. Photo: The Penitent Magdalene by Titian, 1555-1556. Courtesy J. Paul Getty Museum In some way, it is possible to suggest that the question of relevance assumed prominence with the invention of the camera and photography, for one, and growing secularism in the liberal democratic order towards the end of the nineteenth century. The early half of the twentieth century was a period fraught with crisis, reaching its zenith in the Cold War years before the untimely end of history. Writing in the 1950s, when the United States was on the verge of embracing a post-industrialist economic order, novelist William Gaddis proposed that the divorce of art from its higher, divine purpose, coupled with the ever-demanding and cheapening mechanisms of the free market, resulted in artforms that could only deal with fragments (hence Pop Art and Neo-expressionism, among others). Against the growing sophistication of advertising, artificial intelligence, social and communication networks, with an attention-deficit public increasingly alienated from the specialised morays of contemporary practices, art today is coping with the threat of its own obsolescence. TV Text &amp; Image (DREAM NATION) by Gretchen Bender, 1989. Courtesy Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of Scott Hoffman, 2022.65A-B Instagram has emerged as a strong bulwark, a resistance platform through which artists, writers, dealers and institutions alike can propagate and, to put it simply, keep art alive. As a primarily visual platform, Instagram is the likely home for the visual arts. Consider the layout of your typical Instagram page: sleek, chronologically arranged white cubes (or black, depending on your device’s settings) which echo the gallery form itself. The ease with which one scrolls through an Instagram page, post by post, matches the uniformity of the physical exhibition setting. In another sense, Instagram functions as an extensive catalogue which allows viewers unprecedented archival access. To this end, one would almost speak of a democratised artistic experience, to the extent that anyone with an internet connection and login details has access to archival material. Indeed, this is a far cry from the historically hermetic traditions of art institutions and their cross-cultural class biases. One could go so far as suggesting that the gulf between art and the everyday, principally in terms of digital proximity and presence, has been bridged as a result of the ubiquity of cellphones. Electronic Superhighway: Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii by Nam June Paik, 1995. Courtesy Smithsonian American Art Museum and Nam June Paik Estate. Nevertheless, the question of relevance, or the threat of irrelevance, is exacerbated by the technical functions of the platform itself. While it might have been that art was in service of the Church five hundred years ago, today it is subject to flows of information: financial and algorithmic, the two being interchangeable terms at times. Art after instagram is subject to the decontextualisation processes customary to the online experience. The proliferation of images, and their subsequent divorce from meaningful points of reference, amounts to a visual paranoia characterised by dismemberment and discontinuity. The paranoia of the image does not describe an inherent quality of images themselves but our relationship to them: a one-sided preoccupation with the unreal, the fleeting; the image is that which turns and turns in the widening gyre. At the same time, the character of Instagram is such that it reduces everything to content , that is, mere ephemera possessing merit proportional to its hypnotic value: the longer your attention is held, the better the content. Slotted between the irreverent memes and chilling headlines that mar our feeds and psyches, works of art no longer occupy a privileged position. One no longer pauses contemplatively before a painting or sculpture, but scrolls mechanically in search of the next dopamine hit (which, quite unfortunately, are seldom masterpieces). Instagram’s reduction of art, as a privileged activity, to content deepens the chasm between art and non-art. Perhaps there is no art on Instagram, only content that is filtered through an artistic lens (although this is a similarly problematic declaration). Photo: Untitled Computer Drawing by Harold Cohen, 1982. Courtesy Tate Gallery. Conversely, that the platform is fundamentally reductionist has led to a greater pursuit for more authentic ( offline , whatever that means) artistic experiences. For one, it allows us to reevaluate art’s instrumental value in response to existential concerns, while similarly affording greater flexibility for creative, critical and theoretical experimentation. Art after Instagram occupies a paradoxical position, permitting greater access and visibility between audiences while simultaneously negating (or reshaping) our artistic aptitudes. It is a matter of wondering aloud, what is authentic about art in light of the unreal? We know that the end of art was not so much an epilogue as it was a preamble; endings are never final, as James Joyce demonstrated.</description>

      <title>RMB Latitudes built on last year’s successes</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/rmb-latitudes-built-on-last-year-s-successes</link>
      <description>RMB Latitudes built on last year’s successes - By Mary Corrigall RMB Latitudes Art Fair, Reservoir Projects, Lexus Best Stand Winner, photography by Anthea Pokroy -------------- Is there a collective noun for queues of Ubers? Uberrama? Uberclust? Those standing on Hope Street outside Shepstone Gardens during the RMB Latitudes Art Fair weren’t surprised by the sight of lines of Ubers and Lexus cars and complimentary buses ferrying visitors to their cars or front doors. Last year a similar scene had unfurled, as Joburg’s well-to-do, RMB’s VIP clients and the local art community gravitated towards this luxury destination. On the face of it, this fair appeared to be repeating the success of its inaugural run last year. However, if you scrutinised the programme and perused the art closely, Latitudes had turned things up a notch or two. For those who had already been seduced by the gardens last year, there was more to see and do. Aside from off-site adventures, there were more spaces for art such as the Manor House and the gardens functioned as a showroom with sculptures by a range of artists represented by Everard Read Gallery. Without a doubt a large-scale cerise vase by Githan Coopoo emblazoned with the phrase: “I’m sorry I love you too much”, became a visual marker of this year’s edition with it featuring in countless selfies and Insta feeds, living up to its epithet. It was a reminder of the good old days of art fairs when strategically placed eye candy would tease crowds and punctuate rows of paintings. Not that all the sculptural works were OTT. Lebo Kekana’s collaboration with N I S H in the creation of Protoscape , a series of 6 wooden boxes that were placed at the entrance of Latitudes Centre for the Arts was a more understated work. These artisan-made boxes could be moved, around, and stacked to either function as art objects, or design objects – people could sit on them and converse, or simply admire them as abstract forms. This challenged the look-but-don&apos;t-touch culture that has defined art displays. RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2024, Protoscape, by Lebo Kekana of FEDE in collaboration with N I S H, photography by Anthea Pokroy This year&apos;s edition left me with a sense that the organisers and participants have ‘settled’ into this fair and its unique setting. On one level this translated into a better selection of art. Last year, some dealers were perhaps unsure what to show, as they were feeling out the audience that this fair would attract – given RMB’s previous sponsorship of the Turbine Art Fair. The success of that first edition and the lush, upmarket setting established this as a more ‘serious’ (though accessible) fair and it perhaps became clear to some that the intimacy the spaces engender demands more considered art encounters. Steered by the organisers, there was a sense that dealers had planned more thoughtfully and brought new exciting works to the art fair – works that were made with the fair and its setting in mind. Many works were larger in scale and unqiue for that artist&apos;s practice. For example, Kalashnikovv, offered a large-scale work by Boeme Diale (which sold quickly disappearing after the vernissage) in which the naked subject had escaped from the vases she has up until recently been trapped in. On the booth were some unique textile works by Charity Vilakazi that were made by the Keiskamma team in the Eastern Cape. It was easy to imagine that a large painting, Postmodern Antiquity (2024) by Phoka Nyokong - whom I have associated with photography and performance, at the Gallery Momo booth was envisaged as their showstopper for this fair. In contrast to a salon-style hanging of a mixed bag of art, most dealers tended to present a variety of works by three or fewer artists, engendering a closer view into a selection of practices. In this way, you could get an idea of how they stretched out a concept or defined their idiosyncratic aesthetic. For example, a collection of photographic works by Jamal Nxedlana in which he employs clothing labels, either placing them on subjects or generating a collage, established how he was working with this overlooked (though socially and economically loaded) element of clothing – particularly in the context of sartorially inclined photographic art. Seeing one of those works in isolation would not have had as much impact. RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2024, &apos;Untitled&apos; featuring Colijn Strydom&apos;s work, photography by Anthea Pokroy Similarly, in showing a collection of new works by Liam van der Heever, Ebony/Curated were able to demonstrate this artist’s quirky, humourous and surreal vocabulary channelled through a vivid palette that left you with a distinct sense that belying the cheery colours and tongue-in-cheek expression lies a dark reality. Untitled’s mint green wall populated by pastel-coloured works by the hugely talented Colijn Strydom was a visual highlight of the Centre Court. Solo displays by Lucinda Mudge and Kevin Collins in the Chapel were well-paired. RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2024, Frederic Malle x Lucinda Mudge collaboration, photography by Anthea Pokroy Even, Nelson Makamo pulled out all the stops, with a large-scale Untitled painting that aligned with the 30-year democracy anniversary but also the election climate which has turned a spotlight on today’s political leadership. His characteristic bespectacled young subjects surrounded by crowds and some of the country&apos;s late struggle heroes – Madiba, Winnie Mandela – in attendance appeared to summarise the paucity of new leaders of the same heft and how the legacy of the past continues to shape the present. With a R2-million price tag it probably has or will find its way into the hands of those with influence. Of course, this also touches on what is special about this fair; independent artists, who are no longer withering on the side-lines of the art market, can participate in a fair with status even if they do not have gallery representation. RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2024, Nelson Makamo at his booth, photography by Anthea Pokroy As art fairs tend to be staged inside convention centres it is rare to encounter works that are fitting to the environment – unless they happen to offer a wry commentary on art fair culture. This is what is special about Shepstone Gardens and this fair – the myriad of buildings and spaces lend themselves to particular works being shown in them. Two textile works made from silk and beads by Bulumko Mbete presented by Reservoir Projects in the Latitudes Arts Centre appeared like a natural extension of the textured walls in that grand gallery. This – and the marble sculptures by Michele Mathison which also looked at home in the space - no doubt contributed to the gallery walking off with the Lexus Award for the Critics Choice Award for the most outstanding booth. RMB Latitudes 2024, Githan Coopoo sculpture, photography by Anthea Pokroy Architect Kate Otten’s threads , an installation created for the 2023 Venice Biennale of Architecture, proved another showstopper but also one that was appropriately placed. Suspended in a tower it could be viewed from below and above, allowing visitors to enjoy the contrast between the clean surface and the ‘messy’ underside of this superb textile work, which I was grateful South Africans could get to see and enjoy. The placement of an artwork can add to its visual appeal. This point was driven home in the rooftop studios where the stone walls and skylights added drama to several works in the exhibition The Orchid and The Wasp: Thin Lines of Becoming curated by Denzo Nyathi. A bead-encrusted chair, Where you Once Sat , by Salah Davids suited the grand vacant interior that, unlike a white cube or convention centre evoked a human presence, history. The natural light that shone onto Thero Makepe’s Kereke (2019) image presenting a religious ceremony echoed the light forming the centre point of the photograph. This building has a distinctly chapel feel to it too, making the work fitting to its setting. The natural stone backdrop for the painting, To be a kid again , by Ayanfe Olarinde complemented the block shapes of the heads of the subjects, drawing attention to them as youngsters that had yet to be ‘knocked, or carved’ into shape. This characteristic of this art fair, which the variety of venues allows for demonstrates that acquiring art is not only about taste or fashion but relies on a confluence of conditions which include the space where it is intended to be displayed. This also lent richness to the viewing experience of a fair that has evolved into Joburg’s premier art event.

      <title>‘Threads’, an installation by kate otten architects</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/threads-an-installation-by-kate-otten-architects</link>
      <description>&apos; Threads&apos; an installation by kate otten architects Venice Architecture Biennale 2023 “The Laboratory of the Future” curated by Lesley Lokko in the section titled “ Dangerous Liaisons ” --------- In response to the invitation and brief from the curator, Lesley Lokko, and through the lens of how we conceptualise and make architecture, we have designed a piece called ‘threads’ . This architectural installation tells a visual story of Johannesburg, the city where our work as architects takes place. It is a story about how gold came to be here, the mining thereof and the outcomes of this process, narrated by women through different weavings and readings that describe this long history. &apos;threads&apos;, an installation at the 2023 Venice Architecture Biennale, Photography by Ste Murray, image courtesy Kate Otten, ENQUIRE We have designed, crafted and drawn the various parts of the piece and then worked closely with two creative collectives for the realisation of the work. It speaks to our intuitive and collaborative mode of making architecture where colour, light and pattern are important elements in our expression as well as the tactile act of making by hand. ‘threads’ offers different ways of seeing, creating new opportunities for making place for the future that nurtures the human spirit. The golden thread of Johannesburg’s history started some two billion years ago when a massive meteorite crashed into the earth approximately 100kms south of the city sending debris and gold deposits flying, which eventually came to rest in an arc-shaped ridge radiating from the Vredefort Dome – now a world heritage site. The discovery of this gold in 1886, and the gold rush that followed, led to the establishment of Johannesburg and the start of a Dangerous Liaison - between land and people, between great wealth and exploitation. Unlike a linear recording, ‘ threads ’ tells a story that is a simultaneous, intuitive reading of landscape and social geographies, told through age-old traditions of craft and making by hand. There are many readings of this work including an anthropological one where the mohair tapestry is a cloak to wrap the body, the beadwork a necklace to adorn it. The cloak is simultaneously a sociological mapping of the surface landscape and topography where green spaces correspond to privileged, wealthy areas and tree-less areas to poor neighbourhoods, with mining waste dividing the two. Gold mines are represented by yellow pompoms and water courses by blue threads. A round loom was specifically designed for the piece so that the radial nature of the meteorite&apos;s impact could be represented. Detail shot of &apos;threads&apos;, an installation at the 2023 Venice Architecture Biennale, Photography by Ste Murray, image courtesy Kate Otten The beaded necklace is an astrological reading of the night sky above the Vredefort Dome depicting the milky way and constellations. Through this reading, the extracted gold is claimed as an African artefact rather than a commodity to be exported abroad. The glass beads were carefully chosen for colour and consistency and the direction and change of direction of the pattern of threading meticulously ordered to achieve the desired asymmetrical shapes. The backdrop to the work is a contour map showing the mining towns found along the arc-shaped ridge. The piece is lit from above marking shadows on the floor that represent the geology of the area and inscribe it in a circle, defining a space between the floor and weavings. This 3-dimensional, immersive space invites the viewer to experience the piece from above and below, from ‘inside’ and from ‘outside’ as one would a work of architecture. ‘threads’ piece has won the following awards: Gauteng Institute for architects’ award of excellence Gauteng Institute for architects’ People’s choice award.</description>

      <description>Solo Presentation: Abdus Salaam presented by THK Gallery in collaboration with Nirox --------- The word انسان) Insaan) translates as human being. The word’s roots are انس (uns), meaning ‘intimate’ or ‘love’, and نسي) nasyia), meaning ‘forgetful’, defining the human being as both the intimate one and the forgetful one. This poetic fragrance is often alluded to by the mystics and scholars of Islam as it so poignantly delivers us to the essence of humanity being that of love, a reality that we often forget within our terrestrial, ethereal and Divine planes. Abdus Salaam, 2024, Nirox Sculpture Park, courtesy of Nirox This body of work, made over the course of six weeks in residence during the month-long fast of Ramadan, ties this land and its hominid remains, this river and its polluted state, notions of our global environmental shortcomings alongside intimate and personal moments. It asks if perhaps love — or the reminder of it, being the essence of our being and therefore our sanctuary across multiple planes — might ease the anxieties, tensions, and personal fears that we project outwardly into the echo chamber of forgetfulness. Salaam will have a solo presentation at this year&apos;s iteration of the RMB Latitudes Art Fair.

Held in the Screening Room, Chapter 1 starts with water, earth, and light, for we are embodied souls who’s transcendence is through our earthly experience and our planet is but a reflection of our communal state. Chapter 2 is in the Covered Space, with tones of the heart and time, where change is most true. And Chapter 3 is in the Residency Studio.

      <description>People with things, things without people - By Sean O’Toole RMB Latitudes 2024 Featured Artist, Abdus Salaam, NIROX Residency, courtesy Nirox and THK Gallery, viewed here by Kay Kay Ribane --------- The 2024 RMB Latitudes Art Fair will open to the public in late May with a strong sculptural component visible across all of Shepstone Gardens. I want to take this basic fact for a leisurely stroll. Things might briefly get abstract. Stay with me. Now, more than ever, we engage artworks through their virtual proxies, as digital images that are always present, always available, always untouchable. Even sculpture, an insistently physical practice, has been made to yield to this evolutionary advance in human experience. Objects in the round are flattened and compressed into portable digital files. Something is lost. Let’s call it the thingness of things. Just what is it that makes the thingness of things so different, so appealing? There is most likely a credible neuro-scientific explanation, something linked to our evolutionary use of tools, or perhaps it reflects our need to externalise spirituality, but I’m neither a scientist nor a philosopher, merely a littérateur. In 1953, the Irish playwright and poet Samuel Beckett published The Unnamable , the final instalment in a trilogy of difficult and hermetic novels told by single narrators. “What is the correct attitude to adopt towards things?” asks the narrator of The Unnamable . “And, to begin with, are they necessary? What a question!” Indeed, what a question. Beckett – a lodestar to writers J.M. Coetzee and Damon Galgut, as well as artists William Kentridge and Colin Richards – doesn’t answer why things are necessary. Instead, he simply counsels, “If a thing turns up, for some reason or another, take it into consideration.” It is useful advice to bear in mind when negotiating the large sculptural component at the forthcoming edition of RMB Latitudes. Pause. Look. Take the thing, the actual made thing, into consideration. RMB Latitudes 2024 Featured Artist, Atang Tshikare, Semela, 2022, courtesy Everard Read Gallery In choosing to foreground sculpture, the fair is acknowledging what is patent and obvious in the everyday experience of art in South Africa. Sculpture is thriving. Resolutely. Visibly. Differently. In the past few months, I’ve seen fascinating bronze, stone and wood sculptures by, among others, Lea Colombo, Gerhard Marx, Phillip “Boytchie” Newman, Kirstie Pietersen, Abdus Salaam, Inga Somdyala, Atang Tshikare and Anna van der Ploeg. And that’s just in this year, in Cape Town. Making legible and knowable what is palpable and raw defines the role of the curator. It is also summarises the challenge that Lebo Kekana, founder of FEDE Arthouse, has agreed to take on as invited curator of Latitudes Live (Talks and Performances) at the fair. Kekana is an enigmatic shape shifter. A computer scientist by training, he now operates at the fluid intersection of art and design in a role combining the skills of artist, curator and gallery director. Over the past three years, as FEDE transformed from a solo-project to a nomadic gallery run by a trio of friends (Kekana, Nthabiseng Mofokeng, and Carol Khaas), and existing now as a curatorial platform, it has collaborated with various artists, including sculptors Ciara Dunsby and Douglas Gimberg. It will be interesting to see how Kekana and the Latitudes team handle the sculptural component of the fair. It will unavoidably involve unflattening what is compressed by the internet, as well as allowing the thingness of sculpture to declare itself available for consideration across the various spaces – indoor and outdoor – at Shepstone Gardens. The unconventional setting, with its episodic layout and grandiloquent architectural pastiches, poses an explicit counterargument to the grid logic of most contemporary fairs. But that is the big picture stuff. Curatorial ideas play out through specific things. The fair’s programming will include a substantial line-up of sculptural talent, including Abdus Salaam. His stacked work, Our Last Stone (2024), made from river boulders foraged in the Ceres region, was a major pause point at the recent Investec Cape Town Art Fair. Born in Cape Town but partly raised in Los Angeles, Salaam recently completed a residency at Nirox Foundation. Latitudes and THK Gallery will present a solo exhibition of new work made during his time at this sculpture park and artist’s retreat northwest of Johannesburg. RMB Latitudes 2024 Featured Artist, Rina Stutzer, Stealing the Hole in the Sky, 2020, courtesy Everard Read Gallery Over the years, Nirox has staged ambitious showcases exploring the role and prominence of sculpture in the story of contemporary art. Sculptural practice in South Africa is no longer reducible to bronze statues of animals and politicians of the old and new dispensations. The disruptions proposed by historical figures like Bruce Arnott, Edoardo Villa and Noria Mabasa – all past exhibitors at Nirox – opened the doors for the likes of Salaam and Nandipha Mntambo. Mntambo will also show work at Shepstone Gardens, as part of an outdoor presentation of 20 or so works by nearly a dozen artists represented by Everard Read Gallery. Of the decision to present sculpture, Stephanie Le Roy, a curator with Everard Read, said the venue for the fair offered a strong prompt. “Shepstone Gardens provides a wonderful, almost other-worldly backdrop that seamlessly integrates art with nature, showcasing how sculpture can really shine outdoors.” Nicci Bailey – whose 2023 solo exhibition with Everard Read, A Gentle Entanglement , included a moving suite of bronzes portraying fallen birds in various scales – will show a rose quartz sculpture of a dog. Rina Stutzer, who makes affecting bronzes of crows and magpies, will show a 2020 work depicting a raven bearing a gold ring – a reference to Matthias Corvinus, the Raven King of Hungary and Croatia. Other gallery artists with work at the fair include Deborah Bell, Gail Catlin, Norman Catherine, Guy Du Toit, Dylan Lewis, Brett Murray and Angus Taylor, who will show two of his archetypal human figures made from a composite of bronze and stone. “We tend to overlook stone as abundant and everyday – slightly more or less special than what can be found in your garden or park nearby,” Taylor explains in a fascinating interview with artist Johan Thom that introduces his recent Swiss-published monograph, Mind Through Materials (2021). “The intrinsic value or narrative of a specific stone is lost on most viewers if left as is. Through years of working with stone or exhibiting found stone objects, I discovered that, when presented in a resembling shape of, for example, a donkey or human being, it helps to elevate stone as material in its own right.” &apos;Threads&apos;, an installation by RMB Latitudes 2024 Featured Architect, Kate Otten, Venice Architecture Biennale 2023, “The Laboratory of the Future” Kekana is of the same opinion. Last year he produced a bench composed of a plank balanced on large, untreated rocks for an exhibition by painter Jeanne Gaigher. Kekana will reprise his interest in the disruptive potential of bespoke furniture in an exhibition context at Latitudes. He has invited Tanisha Neill, of Cape Town furniture design studio NISH, to create public seating informed by themes of scarcity and adaptive reuse drawn from the commons, in particular street corners or pavements. Can a chair exceed its functionality and become art? Atang Tshikare’s presence on the global stage suggests an affirmative answer. In summary, Tshikare is interested in producing sensory fusions or crossovers that invoke his Tswana heritage. In 2022, he exhibited two lavishly embellished fauteuils (upholstered armchairs) in the exhibition Before Yesterday We Could Fly: An Afrofuturist Period Room at The Met Museum in New York. The retrofitted armchairs retained the form of their French ancestor, but included beaded and woven elements. Drawing on skills passed down from his grandmother, Tshikare additionally charred (partially burned and blackened) the wooden surfaces of the seating. Tshikare will show a work combining his interest in beading and bronze at the fair. Tshikare’s interest in community – in “exchanging information from the lips of knowledge to the ears of inexperience,” as he once phrased it – similarly informs architect Kate Otten’s contribution to the fair. Latitudes will present Otten’s two-part sculptural installation threads (2023). The installation encompasses a hanging disc showing an impressionistic map of the Vredefort Dome rendered in mohair. A team of weavers at Frances V.H Mohair, a bespoke design firm located in the Karoo town of Price Albert, produced the work using a circular loom designed by Otten. RMB Latitudes Art Fair, Shepstone Gardens, Johannesburg “We agreed to the project for many reasons, but mainly because of Katriena Kammies,” wrote designer Frances van Hasselt in an Instagram post last year, shortly before Otten’s collaborative sculpture appeared in Ghanaian curator Lesley Lokko’s much-debated central exhibition at the 2023 Venice Biennale of architecture. One of the first weavers in Prince Albert, Kammies has been practising her craft for over 50 years. “We said yes to this project, because she is a master of her craft and believed strongly that her work should be seen and celebrated on one of the most important platform of makers.” Facility, the ability to do something well, and virtuosity, the exhibition of great skill, remain strong attributes linking the diverse strands of South African sculpture. Notwithstanding a longstanding impulse to simplify and deskill, to work with found things rather than made things, the need to shape encounters with resonant materials endures. While wandering through Shepstone Gardens in May, if an unexpected thing turns up, take it into consideration. Explore it in the round. Think of the many hands that contributed to its production. And consider Beckett’s riddle, posed as a question, “People with things, people without things, things without people, what does it matter?” A lot. Things matter.</description>

      <title>RMB Latitudes Special Project: FEDE</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/rmb-latitudes-special-project-fede</link>
      <description>RMB Latitudes Special Project: FEDE Lebo Kekana, Latitudes Centre for the Arts, Shepstone Gardens, portrait by Earl Abrahams ---------- As one of the year’s special projects, FEDE Arthouse presents a sculptural configuration conceived by the gallery’s director and curator, Lebo Kekana. The project exists as the culmination of a long and playful process of experimentation with form, to investigate its capacity to impose utility upon space — explored in the context of the gallery. FEDE is accustomed to creating spaces that feel like home, and through this presentation, Kekana proposes the idea of using exhibition infrastructure — as a medium of artistic expression with clearly defined functions — to facilitate intuitive engagement with exhibition-goers. This work is intended to hold space and moments of repose for exhibition goers, while also acting as manifestations of proposed ideologies, aesthetic values, and/or acting in support of other works presented in the space for observation. Informed by an understanding of art based on the ideologies of pre-colonial Africa, in which creative expression is tethered to the crafting of functional goods, this work exists between the disciplines defined (in the contemporary sense) as art and design. Thus far, this study has taken shape through make-shift benches, as contributions by Kekana to various exhibitions — as either a curator or an artist — thus existing as a counterpoint for the different parts of his practice, through which he rejects the categorical limitations imposed by discipline. These benches take inspiration from the ingenuity and rigorous utility seen in the infrastructure of many local economies — such as food markets — with stands, tables, and chairs assembled from found objects; this idea of using processed goods in the same way one would use raw materials, showing adaptive reuse, and informed by scarcity (as a condition) to eliminate the superfluous; prioritising function above all else. Through their placement in the exhibition space, the works explicitly emphasise a need for spaces of art consumption to be more accommodating and considerate of other ways of being that aren’t typically accounted for in the space. Direct inspiration is taken from the works crafted by African artisans, used in moments of gathering and ritual. While in the gallery place, the benches also implicitly break the no-touch barrier between “viewer” and “artwork”, imposed by the conditionality of the gallery space and it’s rules of engagement, along with one’s recognition of an object as a work of art through the lens of the European definition of “fine art”. This provocation toward the gallery space is underscored by what Kekana sees as the need to tether the utility of these spaces to the cultures, norms and behaviours of their context, and to facilitate an inclusive sense of comfort and engagement (for the sake of connection) within spaces of gathering. This extends to broader ideas related to the capacity for architecture — which can be thought of as another form of functional artistic practice — to facilitate these same conditions within public spaces. ‘Spirit Bench’, 2023, in collaboration with Jeanne Gaigher, courtesy FEDE For this latest iteration, Kekana joins forces with N I S H, a Cape Town based design studio which aims to bring an interdisciplinary approach to furniture design. Through contemporary, elegant and progressive designs that lean on skilful craftsmanship and the use of natural materials, the studio creates multifunctional pieces that adapt and form an essence unique to the environment and user that takes them on. Together, Kekana and N I S H have created a body of modular, inter-joining forms, that make room for play and intuitive use. The functional sculptures blend Nguni aesthetic values around material and form, with an understanding of modern techniques, as well as a refined and contemporary design style.</description>

      <title>French Institute of South Africa welcomes Occupying the Gallery for artists residency ahead of RMB Latitudes Art Fair</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/french-institute-of-south-africa-welcomes-occupying-the-gallery-for-artists-residency-ahead-of-rmb-latitudes-art-fair</link>
      <description>Occupying the Gallery with The French Institute of South Africa in collaboration with Artist Proof Studio Sphatho Mzantsi, 2024, Umkhomo, Etching with Chine Collé ---------- From 16 April - 16 May 2024, Occupying the Gallery will make a home in Braamfontein for a special edition with the French Institute of South Africa (IFAS) in collaboration with Artist Proof Studio. A reconfiguration, the IFAS first floor is now an open studio dedicated to the artistic incubation of a handful of occupants. Established by internationally acclaimed visual artists Mary Sibande and Lawrence Lemaoana, Occupying the Gallery is a project where artists take up residence in and transform an otherwise used space into an active open working environment that offers access into artistic processes. Following the month-long residency, with the support of IFAS, the artworks and prints produced with Artist Proof Studio during this period will be presented at the RMB Latitudes Art Fair in Johannesburg from 23 - 26 May 2024. With every residency, Occupying the Gallery partners with a master print and publishing house where artists conceptualise a series of prints that will inform the bodies of work they will produce while in residency. For this season’s occupation, the partnership is with Artist Proof Studios. Leaders in fine art printmaking since 1991, Artist Proof Studios specialises in training, collaborating and distributing prints in partnership with artists. For the occupation, Sibande and Lemaoana will be joined by a cohort of seven made up of the following artists and technicians: Mosa Anita Kaiser, Hoek Swaratlhe, Londiwe Mtshali, Sphatho Mzantsi, Bongani Ndlovu, Tatenda Magaisa and Mlondi Magubane. Mosa Anita Kaiser, 2024, Clothed in Blue, Etching, Chine Collé and Hand painted ink An artist&apos;s studio represents a generative period of trial and error. Conventionally private, access to their movements, frustrations, breakthroughs and works in progress is a vulnerable invitation to build an insightful relationship with their practice. Through this, the residency looks to have a two-fold impact. On one hand, by functioning as a studio, the residency offers the IFAS team — whose work centres around supporting and connecting practitioners in creative and cultural industries — access to the processes and practices of artists. On the other hand, it offers the same artists insight into life at IFAS. This initiative is supported by the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs and the Institut français as part of the strategy for the international export of cultural and creative industries.</description>

      <description>Synergy in partnership Imperatives for new art fair business models in the changing art market - by Valerie Kabov Victor Ubah, Ethereal Time, 2023, acrylic on canvas, presented by Wunika Mukan Gallery, Lagos Contemporary art in the 21st century is very much a globalised industry, turbo-charged by the internet. Certainly, the rise of market engagement by African art has been amplified and accelerated by online engagement and social media. However, like many hyped panaceas, while the internet is a crucial tool for art in the 21st century, time and again IRL proves irreplaceable and calls for innovation on its own terms. Recently released Art Basel UBS Art Market Report 2024, reflected at length on concerns of art dealers emerging over the rising costs of doing business in the globalised art market, with profit margins in 2023 dropping, even as the number of transactions increases. This has been attributed to inflation and the impact on prices of oil by the wars in the Ukraine and the Middle East. While art fairs may seem conceptually far away from global turbulence, as internationally engaged stakeholders, massively dependent on logistics and travel, the industry as a whole, and art fairs in particular, are very vulnerable to the impact of international conflagrations. In the context of Africa, these vulnerabilities are often amplified relative to our peers in Europe and USA, which, even with inflation, benefit from economies of scale across the whole production chain, from cost of materials to cost of travel and shipping. The cost of compensating for gaps in infrastructure, like locally produced art materials and reliance on air freight in the absence of trains or reliable road transport, are an additional obstacle to market engagement for African galleries looking to engage new markets and audiences. Much has been said about the expansion of the online art market to democratise access to the art market to participants outside the major art centres. Indeed, online sales have now become a stable component of the art market, catapulted during covid lockdowns. However, post covid lockdown, online sales have receded and USA, China, UK and France remain the major art market centres of the world. This is because buying art is not simply a transaction, it is a unique individual experience mediated by a relationship of trust with a lot of personal and emotional import, that cannot be replicated on the screen. This is why audiences returned to art fairs with gusto once lockdowns were lifted and the places with best infrastructure support and investment in culture continue to have a distinct advantage. Birhane Worede, Morning Interaction With Space, 2023, oil on canvas, price on request, presented by Chilli Art Projects, ENQUIRE Given this imbalance, art fairs on the continent have a unique responsibility to think of themselves not just as profit-making entities selling real estate, but also with recognition of their role in the evolving ecosystem. Understanding the obstacles to engagement faced by their clients, galleries can help shape innovative business models and build synergistic partnerships, which expand engagement and build quality, at the same time benefiting new and established collecting audiences. Latitudes’ International Galleries Platform (IGP) was launched in 2023 with the aim of introducing the Johannesburg audience to a greater variety of art and artists from across Africa and around the world, and to make the decision of coming to a new fair in South Africa an easy one. According to Nina Carew, the convenor for IGP, the decision for galleries is in fact a ‘no-brainer’. ‘The platform offers galleries the opportunity to send artworks to showcase in Johannesburg, which are installed and sold by the Fair on behalf of the gallery, thus alleviating the gallery of the burden of paying for a standalone booth and any associated travel costs. As such, galleries have very few overheads and participating at a Fair dedicated to art from Africa becomes more accessible than ever.’ International Galleries Platform booth at RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2023, photo by Anthea Pokroy According to Carew, the wins are equally viable for ‘both emerging galleries that are looking to participate at a fair for the first time, and for established galleries with a very full programmes calendar that would like to get a feel for a new fair without needing to overstretch their team.’ Second year in, IGP 2024 expanded from 7 to 10 participants, and will host galleries from Nigeria, Angola, Uganda and Botswana as well France, Germany, Switzerland, UK, Spain and Portugal (all selling African contemporary art), with demand outstripping supply of available spaces. Kaleab Abate, Purple Dreams, 2023, mixed media on paper, R29,000.00 excluding VAT, presented by Afriart Gallery, ENQUIRE Going forward, IGP ‘sits at the heart of RMB Latitudes’ pursuit to engage internationally’…’democratises the art fair structure’ and is envisaged to ‘grow in pan-African and diasporic representation and to become known as a fair that offers accessible and alternate modes of exhibiting’, says Carew. The increased interest in this kind of participation has also created curatorial opportunities for the Latitudes team to again think proactively and progressively about their audience engagement and education. Working with the team of emerging and established curators in the fair context, Carew points out that it is, “imperative to work collaboratively with galleries to ensure the selection makes sense to their endeavours, while presenting artists and artworks which hold important conceptual and thematic resonance with RMB Latitudes’ audience. Furthermore, it is important in our selection process that works are carefully considered so that participating artists are not represented tokenistically but rather curated in a nuanced way that speaks to their unique practices.” By innovating, an initiative like IGP turns challenges of the art market into an opportunity, with generative synergies benefiting galleries, artists and audiences. It is a great example of how African sectors can leapfrog the limitations of legacy infrastructures and operate in a way that is responsive to local needs, not only not compromising on quality but enhancing it.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/ntlo-e-etsamayang-the-walking-house-mmakgabo-mmapula-helen-sebidi</link>
      <description>Ntlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House), Mmakgabo Mmapula Helen Sebidi - By Gabriel Baard Mmakgabo Mmapula Helen Sebidi, Mafatsi A Tlhakana (The Meeting of Different Realms), (1991), Pastel on paper, 147 by 109 cm, Artists collection There is an undeniable mystique and captivating allure surrounding Mmakgabo Sebidi&apos;s art – a depth that invites exploration, akin to the intricate layers of her own life story woven into each artwork. Mmakgabo stands as the bridge between many worlds, a vehicle for communication, a walking house. This house was built inside her by her matriarch grandmother, who would say: &quot;Do not be mistaken. The mud walls we are building are not the real house but merely shelter from the sun and the rain. It is you I am building into a walking house destined for where our sun sets and rises to houses that, like you, are built from hard labour. It is here you will knock on the door of each house and be received. Together, through sweat and blood, you will master every conceivable challenge.&quot; Art has always been deeply rooted in Mmakgabo’s cultural heritage, reflecting a profound reverence for the values that have shaped her upbringing and worldview. Having become the first black recipient of the Standard Bank Young Artist prize (1989), Mmakgabo is representative of a turning point in national politics that was taking place in the 80s and 90s, a time when the days of apartheid were numbered. Within this transformative narrative, she emerged as a symbol of resilience and political awakening, capturing the essence of a nation in flux. Her work during this time, reifies the personal as political, and political as personal, unbounded from conventions of resistance or feminist art. During many of our conversations, Mmakgabo has described how she would “move blindly in this world”, a process dedicated to research outside and distinct from the typical and concretised methodologies before her. It is instead, an unpredictable and fluid push and pull of possibilities and potentialities. Gabriel Baard with Helen Sebidi, courtesy of University of Johannesburg “I like moving blindly. It is like being given the words. Questioning them, that is research. But you won’t know how they build you. They will not make you open your mouth. They will let you move where you want to go. Knowing is the difficult part.” In this way, her enunciation of subjectivity reflects the conflicts taking place at this time in a way that no one else could, having been realised outside realms of consciousness while remaining deeply connected to land and people. Read in the context of resistance or protest art, her work does not conform to this symptomatic art historical. Its language is its own, a conglomerate of witnessed, felt, and lived turmoil and trauma, pulsating with energy, and rejecting fixed definitions. Her full title, Mmakgabo Mmapula Mmankgato Helen Sebidi, carries the weight of her identity, having been named Mmapula, mother of rain, by her community, as a long drought ended following her birth. While Sebidi, meaning ‘boiling’ seems to overflow in an energetic pulse which runs through her core, often saying to me, “My work is never done. I am living for the children.” Through her unique portrayal of the human form, Mmakgabo delves into the complexities of black identity and spirituality, offering a poignant reflection on the African experience. Yet, amidst political turmoil, she faced moral dilemmas, navigating the delicate balance between artistic expression and social responsibility. When she received an invitation to speak in the US, she grappled with the implications of violating the UN boycott of apartheid South Africa. Ultimately, she chose to follow her convictions, defying the naysayers and embarking on a journey that further solidified her reputation as a trailblazing artist. Mmakgabo Mmapula Helen Sebidi, Kamogelo ya Moya (Conversing with the spirits), (1991) Pastel on paper, 73 by 109cm, Artists collection In 1991, Mmakgabo&apos;s journey took her to Sweden, where she hoped to share her vision with a new audience. However, what should have been a triumph turned into heartbreak when her works disappeared without a trace, leaving behind unanswered questions and unresolved grief. It is these very artworks which will be exhibited for the first time at the UJ gallery, having been recently discovered in the attic of a Folk High school where Mmakgabo was based during her stay in 1991. Ntlo E Etsamayang , (The Walking House) serves as a celebration of Mmakgabo’s remarkable artistic journey and commitment to Indigenous Knowledge Systems, confronting themes of self-positioning, power, responsibility, and healing. Marked by the recovery of 28 lost artworks following more than three decades of grief, this exhibition reflects on the exchange of knowledge between South Africa and Sweden, highlighting Sebidi&apos;s dedication to facilitating communication of the socio-political conditions that govern day-to-day existence. The artworks in this exhibition not only reclaim lost masterpieces to the public eye but resurrect a critical chapter in the national artistic consciousness. Each work communicates an acute and unbounded search into the relationship between humanism and spiritualism of the contemporary black African lived experience. This exhibition showcases not only Mmakgabo’s early artistic endeavours but also a pivotal juncture in her practice, heralding a significant moment of stylistic transformation into a new idiom; part figuration, part abstraction, yet continuously seeking to escape the boundaries of both. Helen Sebidi Exhibition at the University of Johannesburg Mmakgabo turned 81 recently, having been born at the dawn of Bantu education. She stands today as a poignant metaphor for the collective struggle. Her art serves as a powerful reminder of heritage while simultaneously offering a visionary perspective for the future. Through her body of work, Mmakgabo nourishes the soul of the nation. Her work showcases a deep reverence for the values that have influenced her. Her art depicts the disordered and often uncomfortable process of decolonising, through which she has cultivated a visual language that compels us to feel things, to get our hands dirty. As we stand on the doorstep of thirty years of democracy, many young voters feel this is their 1994. Urged to not only make a change but embody that change, and understanding the importance of these elections as a defining moment in South Africa’s history, I cannot help but see the synchronicities between these moments of change through the lens of Mmakgabo’s rediscovered art. In this context, Mmakgabo said something profound to me the other day. “I feel that they [her artworks] were hidden for this communication to be extended,” suggesting that if her works had been exhibited and returned to her in 1991, they would most certainly have been sold and the communication ended. This body of work, brought into the world just before the dawn of our democracy and returned 30 years later, is a portrait of humanity in a kaleidoscopic montage of political turmoil, and lost for three decades. It represents a moment of antipodal communication frozen in time that is perhaps more poignant today than ever. Mmakgabo Mmapula Helen Sebidi, Are Faneng Bophelo (Exchange), (1990) Pastel on paper, 81,6 by 55,4cm, Artists collection As we prepare to unveil Mmakgabo&apos;s lost masterpieces to the world, I am filled with awe and gratitude. It has been a journey of rediscovery – of art, resilience, and the enduring spirit of hope. She is more than an artist; she is a storyteller, a visionary, a beacon of hope. Through her art, she invites us on a journey of self-discovery and transformation, reminding us of the power of creativity to transcend boundaries and unite us in shared experiences of beauty and truth. In the enigmatic world of Mmakgabo Sebidi, we find solace, inspiration, and a profound connection to the human experience.</description>

      <description>Diriyah Art Futures opens applications for emerging new media artists The exciting educational programme will be hosted in the soon-to-open Diriyah Art Futures centre, the region’s first facility dedicated to New Media Arts Photo credits Hassan Ali Al-Shatti Courtesy Schiattarella Associati ----------------- The Saudi Ministry of Culture has announced a call for applications for its ‘Emerging New Media Artist’ Programme, set to take place at the soon-to-open Diriyah Art Futures (DAF) centre. The programme, which is targeted at emerging creatives from within the region and beyond, provides emerging artists with access to cutting-edge professional equipment, a production budget, and a wide range of multidisciplinary learning opportunities, including personal mentorship from prominent international digital artists. The programme is part of a wider partnership between the Ministry and Diriyah Company which will be launching Diriyah Art Futures as the region’s first centre dedicated to New Media Arts. DAF aims to facilitate creativity across various visual art disciplines through education, empowerment, and the creation of an environment that fosters artistic imagination. Located in Historical Diriyah, the centre will nurture the thriving artistic scene in Saudi Arabia and reaffirm the site’s position as a global cultural destination. Designed in collaboration with Le Fresnoy - Studio National des Arts Contemporains in France, DAF’s Emerging New Media Artists Programme is a one-year long programme supporting creative production training. The call for applications for DAF’s Emerging New Media Artists Educational Programme is now open. Applicants should be 35 years or younger, at graduate or postgraduate completion stage and have experience in developing and creating digital and new media arts. Interested candidates may find information, selection criteria and apply to the programme here . Latitudes spoke to Ibrahim Alsanousi, the acting CEO of Museums Commission, to learn more about their project. Latitudes Online (LO): Can you give us more information about the art scene in Saudi Arabia &amp; the MENA region? Ibrahim Alsanousi (IA): The Middle East and North Africa have very rich traditions of cultural expression, and this is evident in the various modern and contemporary art movements we see across the region. Because this region is so diverse, it allows for a multiplicity of stunning perspectives, inspirations and creative movements. A region with a very young population, it is naturally overflowing with many creative voices, searching for new platforms to express themselves. In recent years, the Arabian Peninsula has emerged as a new global capital of arts and culture. While there are many incredible projects throughout the region, this growth has been accelerated by Saudi Arabia, which is developing a vast array of groundbreaking new events and institutions at an unprecedented rate. This is a country where most people are below the age of 30. They represent a new generation of ambitious young minds, who are excited about emerging technology, and keen to explore new avenues to express their unique perspectives on a regional and global stage. This thriving new ecosystem acts as a magnet for creative talent from across the MENA region, and a melting pot for experiences, perspectives and ideas. Photo credits Hassan Ali Al-Shatti Courtesy Schiattarella Associati LO: How would you say DAF is advancing the field of new media and digital arts? IA: As the MENA region’s first dedicated New Media and Digital Arts centre, DAF is a unique amalgamation of school, laboratory and exhibition space. Our centre not only offers world-class instruction under the guidance of leading New Media and Digital Artists, but also access to cutting-edge facilities and an exhibition space. This gives our students an opportunity to explore the latest mediums and issues in the field, experiment and produce groundbreaking work, and showcase it alongside digital art pioneers. Although we have a global focus, by inviting artists from across the world, we maintain a regional perspective. Saudi Arabia offers a fascinating new creative context, and we aim to reflect this across our programming as we explore new future possibilities, free from the constraints of older paradigms that have dominated art world narratives and creative production. LO: I see the programme is one year, starting on 24 Sept and ending 25 Aug. Could you provide a breakdown of what the programme will look like? IA: During the first three months, participants will engage in a series of thematic and conceptual explorations led by prolific new media and digital artists and theorists, spanning seminars, workshops, lectures and screenings. This is followed by six months of personalised mentorship from prominent artists. During this period, the participants also produce their own artworks using the technologies offered by the Diriyah Art Futures labs. The final three months consist of a deep dive into cutting-edge technologies such as advanced audio-visual, immersive reality, coding, sensing, machine learning and spatial audio-visual environments. LO: Can you touch on the significance of the programme being set at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Al-Diriyah? IA: The intersection between past, present and future is a central theme in DAF’s mission and vision. Situated in the historical UNESCO World Heritage site of Al-Diriyah, DAF embodies this intersection by integrating the rich cultural heritage of Saudi Arabia with cutting-edge developments in art, science and technology. Designed by Italian architectural firm Schiattarella Associati, DAF&apos;s 6,550m2 centre is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and labs. Set against the historic backdrop, the centre symbolises DAF’s vision of empowering the next generation to shape the future, with a firm foundation in the cultural and historic context of Saudi Arabia and the region. By establishing DAF as a hub for New Media and Digital Arts, the Ministry of Culture of Saudi Arabia, in partnership with Diriyah Company, is not only preserving the country’s unique heritage but also paving the way for future artistic endeavours. The centre serves as a bridge between the past, with its historical significance, and the future, with its focus on emerging artistic practices. The Emerging New Media Artists Programme, developed in collaboration with Le Fresnoy - Studio National des Arts Contemporains, exemplifies this intersection by providing emerging artists with access to state-of-the-art equipment and training while nurturing creativity in a historically significant location. This programme not only embraces the innovative spirit of the present but also ensures that the artistic heritage of the region continues to evolve and thrive into the future. Photo credits Hassan Ali Al-Shatti Courtesy Schiattarella Associati LO: What is the link between new media and sustainability? Could you talk to the importance of digital art having a place in Saudi Arabia? IA: Saudi Arabia is a country in the process of transformation. We are rapidly developing new frameworks and models to diversify our economy away from oil and integrate groundbreaking new sustainability initiatives. Part of this process includes an unprecedented investment in arts and culture. This provides a fascinating new context for creative expression, especially for the forward-thinking approach by digital artists and scholars. Many of these new disruptive technologies represent a break from existing models, and this is something we understand very well in Saudi Arabia. We are uniquely well positioned to explore the creative mediums of the future and develop solutions to some of the issues surrounding them, unfettered by older methods of thinking. LO: How would you say a programme like this fosters collaboration in the Global South? IA: A programme like DAF’s Emerging New Media Artists Programme has the potential to foster collaboration in the Global Majority in several ways, including through facilitating cross-cultural exchange by attracting emerging artists from various countries within the Global Majority which are currently underrepresented in the space. Participants bring diverse perspectives, experiences and artistic traditions, creating opportunities for collaboration and mutual learning. The programme also provides a platform for emerging artists from the Global Majority to connect with each other, as well as with established artists and institutions in the region and beyond. These connections can lead to future collaborations, joint projects and artistic initiatives that transcend geographical boundaries. Furthermore, artists from the Global Majority often face similar challenges related to limited resources, infrastructure and access to opportunities. Participating in a programme like this allows them to share their experiences and brainstorm innovative solutions together, fostering a sense of solidarity and collective empowerment. Then, by showcasing the work of these emerging artists, the programme amplifies their voices on the international stage. This exposure not only benefits individual artists but also contributes to greater visibility and recognition of the diverse artistic practices and narratives emerging from the region. Photo credits Hassan Ali Al-Shatti Courtesy Schiattarella Associati LO: So much of what one reads is through a Western lens, how do you think that women artists will navigate the arts scene in Saudi Arabia? AI: Saudi Arabia’s creative scene is marked by a wonderfully diverse range of perspectives, and this includes both strong male and female participation. Throughout our major events, exhibitions and institutions, we are proud to feature prominent representation from women from all backgrounds. Moving forward, as Saudi Arabia continues to develop its arts and culture sectors, we are happy to see even more young women eager to embrace the new opportunities that have opened up through the ambition of Vision 2030. LO: What is the full takeaway from this residency for artists across the globe? And in that same breath, what are you hoping to achieve from this? IA: DAF’s residency programme offers artists across the globe a unique opportunity for growth, exploration and collaboration in the field of New Media and Digital Art. Participating artists will have access to cutting-edge equipment, mentorship from prominent international digital artists, and a wide range of multidisciplinary learning opportunities. This exposure enhances their technical skills, conceptual understanding, and creative vision, contributing to their professional development. The programme also provides artists with a supportive environment and resources to explore new ideas, experiment with innovative technologies and push the boundaries of their artistic practice. Participating artists will be able to connect with peers, mentors and industry professionals from diverse backgrounds and cultures. These connections can lead to meaningful collaborations, joint projects and future opportunities for artistic exchange and partnership. Finally, the residency culminates in curated exhibitions and public presentations, providing artists with a platform to showcase their work to a global audience. This exposure helps artists gain recognition, expand their reach, and establish themselves within the art scene. DAF aims to nurture the next generation of cutting-edge artists and contribute to the development of the creative ecosystem in Saudi Arabia and beyond. By providing artists with the support, resources and opportunities they need to thrive, DAF seeks to empower emerging talent and foster a vibrant artistic community while positioning the Kingdom as a leading hub for artistic innovation and collaboration on the global stage. Photo credits Hassan Ali Al-Shatti Courtesy Schiattarella Associati LO: How does this residency programme respond to the shift in the art climate with the rise of AI? Do you consider new media art linked to AI or is it different all together? IA: Our Emerging New Media Artists Programme aims to immerse artists in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of New Media Arts. New Media Arts includes every form of contemporary art that is produced, altered or transmitted through new forms of media technology. While this can be traced back to the 19 th century, today it is most commonly associated with digital and electronic mediums. Of course, in this digital age, technology is developing at an exponential rate. As one of the most significant digital technologies today, set to totally transform our relationships with the digital world, AI naturally falls within this realm. In fact, art and image generation is one of the arenas in which this technology has already made its potential so immediately apparent. Today, AI tools are already empowering people with no formal art training or creative background to create artworks. On one hand, this is creating space for an influx of impactful new perspectives, but it also raises questions over the value and recognition of those who have devoted their lives to their crafts. Of course, as AI continues to grow in power and potential, this impact is only going to grow stronger. Going forwards, we will need to address other questions over where inspiration ends and plagiarism begins, what it means to be an ‘artist’, and how best to navigate the relationship between art and technology. Most importantly, throughout our residencies and programming, we&apos;re committed to exploring how we can bring together artists and technologists to harness the potential of emergent creative toolkits to empower the next generation of creatives to shape the future in the most harmonious way possible.

      <title>Q&amp;A with Adele van Heerden</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/q-a-with-adele-van-heerden</link>
      <description>Q&amp;A with Adele van Heerden We chatted with artist Adele van Heerden to learn more about her extensive practice. Adele van Heerden, Mirror exhibition, 131A Gallery, photo by Paris Brummer ------------- Adele van Heerden&apos;s work explores the relationships between built and natural environments, design and art, and abstraction and figuration. Latitudes Online (LO): When did you first realise you wanted to be an artist? And how did you realise your practice from there? Adele van Heerden (AH): I don&apos;t remember a time when I wasn&apos;t painting and drawing, it came very naturally to me from a young age. I am an only child and there was a lot of free time for just hanging out on my own with my drawing books, I took them with me everywhere I went. When the time came to start making study choices the decision to study Fine Arts felt very clear. LO: How do you like to describe your practice? What are important thematic considerations for your practice? AH: My work is largely autobiographical, so paintings are based on what I see and experience around me. I try to connect with the feeling of a place. When drawing and painting, I try to re-connect with those feelings; to process emotions and commemorate special moments. I try to remember and revisit them in a gentle way. Nature has forever been a source of inspiration for me, it teaches me a lot about grounding and slowing down in a world that feels like it is chaotic and accelerating very quickly. I love how present swimming makes you feel, and I try to emulate this feeling in my artistic practice. Thematic considerations that continue to come up in my work are the relationships between built, human-made and natural environments, design and art, and abstraction and figuration. I am continually inspired by the shorelines, architecture, and nature around my home in Cape Town. Adele van Heerden, Mirror exhibition, 131A Gallery, photo by Paris Brummer LO: I was wondering which artist[s] has/have influenced your work and how they have done so? AH: I cannot stop talking about our lord and saviour, David Hockney! Today he is undoubtedly one of the most influential Pop Art artists of the 20th century. I think besides his iconic work about Californian swimming pools, I resonate with him because his work and practise is sourced from love. His subject matter is drawn from his own experiences and what he sees around him: he painted portraits of his friends and lovers, his dogs, trees, water, landscapes and reflections. His dedication to a daily drawing and painting practise is something I can relate with on a spiritual level. He&apos;s propelled by his infectious enthusiasm and interests, and moved around quite a bit. Throughout his life he lived in Paris, Bridlington, California, Malibu, Normandy, London and Bradford. This kind of multi-city living is something I fantasise about myself. He also tends to return to a particular motif, again and again, something that I seem to do myself. LO: Talk us through the exhibition Mirror; where does the title come from, and what’s the overall theme? AH: The exhibition is the culmination of a year-long journey that began during a residency at Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris, where I engaged in swimming in and painting the city&apos;s iconic swimming pools as part of the ongoing A La Piscine project. On returning to Cape Town, I shifted my focus to the coastal shorelines and the local municipal swimming pool, Long Street Baths. My intention was to connect with these spaces, using my body, sketchbook, and camera to observe and engage with the environment. The resulting works aim to capture the mood of these environments. The title, &quot;Mirror,&quot; refers to the water&apos;s surface as a physical mirror reflecting the surrounding elements, be it the sky, weather, rock, or architectural structures. This mirror, when clear, also reveals the hidden worlds beneath the water. My work has always been concerned with the connection between us humans and natural environments. The waterscapes in Mirror are all based on specific locations I have visited. As I carried on with the project it also became an interior exploration. Water is a medium that affects light, refracting and reflecting it. One can find a whole world in a pool: sky, plants, light and darkness reflecting trees and clouds: a natural mirror. In French such a decorative tank of water one will often find in a park is called a “mirroir d&apos;eau”. I started thinking about how to represent transparency and how one draws something one can see through. A transparent object like a piece of glass is simultaneously there and not there. It&apos;s the object itself, with ripples and sparkles on the surface, and also a medium through which you can view things. Human beings are attracted to shiny objects, things that reflect our appearance back. This also led me to thinking about how another can act a mirror to the self. Sometimes we just need to make a connection, have our thoughts and feelings seen and reflected back to us. The metaphor of the mirror extends to the idea of individuals as mirrors to each other, reflecting personas and experiences, creating an energy transfer of seeing and being seen. Adele Van Heerden, Piscine Butte Aux Cailles Interior, 2023, Pastel and Gouache on Film, 84 x 118cm, R 32,200.00 ex. VAT, Presented by 131A Gallery, ENQUIRE LO: I’ve noticed you have an affinity to water and the colour blue – could you talk to that? AH: The project of painting water started in 2021, when I was diagnosed with a hip condition that demanded surgery and a lot of rehabilitation, so I started swimming in the seas and pools of Cape Town. When I&apos;m at the pool I just love to focus my eyes, and stare at the patterns from the lines and tiles at the bottom of a swimming pool. The way the water always moves and twists what is underneath, appearing like a kind of warping mesh. The &quot;Modulations&quot; series within the exhibition delves into these distortions and abstractions of shapes within swimming pools: the undulating lines of tiles, lanes, and the interior architecture of pools, frozen in time. I often look out for patterns and recurrent visual motifs. During my time in Paris, I noticed a lot of a distinctive ultramarine blue hue in certain environments. The sky is the largest blue object in nature. On the other hand the ocean appears blue due to the absorption of colours in the red portion of the light spectrum. This process acts like a filter, allowing colours in the blue part of the light spectrum to remain visible to us. I think human-made swimming pools are an excellent example of merging nature and technology. The typical blue, or turquoise, or aquamarine of the pool’s painted or tiled walls gives a feeling of unreal water. Out there, in nature, bodies of water (like oceans and lakes) are often more likely to appear the colour of copper, or gunmetal, or ink, or sand. LO: Can you talk to us about the medium and technique you use? What is gouache on film? AH: I draw and paint onto the front and back of semi-translucent architectural drafting film, sometimes also called Mylar or Duralar, in a technique of reverse-painting I developed myself. I&apos;ll usually start with a line drawing in pastel, colour pencil or ink. I would then turn the transparent paper around and start painting on the back of the substrate in Gouache: lightest colours first, then moving to darks and finally the mid-tones. I&apos;ll turn the paper around again, and sometimes push tonalities if I feel it&apos;s necessary. I developed this methodology over the last 4 years and I&apos;m still finding new and interesting ways of pushing the medium. Gouache is similar to watercolour but is modified to make it opaque. It consists of natural pigment, water and a binding agent (gum arabic or dextrin) and has been used most consistently for graphic work like posters, illustrations, comics and design work. It also has a higher ratio of pigment to binder compared to watercolours so you can get more solid colour fields compared to other water-based paints. Adele van Heerden, Echo, 2024, Colour Pencil and Gouache on Film, 60x84cm, Presented by 131 A Gallery, ENQUIRE LO: How does a drawing/painting emerge for you? Do you take photographs of the spaces you encounter? Or do you perhaps visit the space, sit there, sketch it and then base your painting off of that? Curious to know the journey here. AH: Swimming is an embodied experience for me: the body serves as a sensory apparatus through which findings are made. The water-body I move in is the &apos;object&apos; through which these revelations are made. I recently also started shooting underwater film photography which has been very exciting, I am returning to film photography for the first time in 15 years. The photographs turn out very differently depending on the light conditions, clarity of the water and colours in the environment. I think the human body is a convenient place from which to engage in philosophical and observational practise. In this phase I&apos;ll consider my camera and an extension of my body, eyes and brain. After this I&apos;ll print out some of my pictures, return to my studio, and create paintings based on my experiences and photographs in the form of paintings and drawings. LO: What’s one piece of advice you can give to emerging artists trying to make their mark? AH: Keep your friends close! In addition to continually refining and developing your practise, networking will also be your life&apos;s work. A friend once told me that networking happens when you&apos;re having fun, so concentrate on making friends you would like to have on the journey with you. Very early on I was part of some DIY-style collectives at studios and we hosted and curated our own exhibitions throughout the years. It was very punk-rock. The first one was on top of a panel beater workshop in Harrington Street. The core-group from there is now Sidetrack Studio, and with growth and experience I think we&apos;ve managed to build a supportive community - thinking back, these early years were very formative for me. LO: How do you maintain a dedicated practice? AH: I&apos;m very routine-driven and I maintain a daily art-making practise. I like to set up personal rituals for myself that help the day feel more balanced and streamlined. I prefer to start early because that&apos;s when I feel clearest. I find I feel my best when I&apos;m painting a lot. I try to work on a variety of projects throughout the year: exhibitions, commissions, residencies, collaborative projects. They all feed me in different ways. Keeping the structure of a typical day is important, from waking up at a set time and getting dressed in all black, to going to sleep at a regular time. I have small rituals to start or end the day, whether it’s having a coffee or a quick meditation. I think having a space that is dedicated to my practice is crucial for productivity. Once I get to the studio I try to get into a certain kind of headspace, concentration so intense that I don’t think of anything else but the painting in front of me, a state of flow. Time distorts and suddenly 5 hours has gone by and my dog is suddenly reminding me it&apos;s time to go for a walk. Adele Van Heerden, Piscine Josephine Baker, ink and gouache on film R32,200.00 ex. VAT, Presented by 131 A Gallery, ENQUIRE LO: During your residency in Paris, did you find the water and iconic swimming pools that you explored and researched, a similar experience to the swimming pool spaces you visit in South Africa? Or was it very different, and how so? AH: Swimming culture is a bit different there but there are also many similarities. There are 42 municipal swimming pools in Paris. I didn&apos;t get around to going to all of them in the time I was there, but the A La Piscine project is ongoing, so I&apos;ll definitely return to continue my work and research there. I met so many friendly people while swimming there, we managed to have conversations in the water and in the changing rooms despite my extremely limited (read, non-existent) French language skills. I think the water really opens people up, there is a mood of ebullience and connectedness with other swimmers despite our backgrounds or cultures. A lot of French people e-mailed and messaged me on Instagram when they found out about my project. Many of them wanted to go for coffee to talk more about pools, go swimming together or collaborate. Swimming in different cities made me realise that swimming relaxes people a lot, and brings strangers together in a universal kind of way. I&apos;m interested in the stories around pools and their specific histories. I find each pool has it&apos;s own personality and quirks. In Paris, many of them are named after important figures in French swimming history: Alfred Nakache, Suzanne Berloux, Annette Kellermann, Alice Milliat, Yvonne Godard, Jean Taris to name a few. I remember my first time getting in a Parisian pool it felt to me like there was a pool-going social contract I wasn&apos;t aware of in South Africa. I asked the person swimming next to me what the rules were. She replied: “There are many rules but we don&apos;t know what they are”. The Long Street Baths (my local swimming pool), is an indoor “secret sanctuary” at the top of Long Street in the CBD of Cape Town. It&apos;s built in a combination of Art Nouveau, Victorian and Edwardian styles. It&apos;s an important place of gathering, part of the &apos;social infrastructure&apos; that contributes to the public life of the city of Cape Town and makes it possible for people to connect and build community. In this context, the Long Street Baths is a safe space, with many good memories for people of different generations and backgrounds. I often hear about friends&apos; fathers who used to work in the area and go swimming there at lunch time or after work, rather than going to the pub. For years the baths were known as the “slipper baths”, I read that people who lived in the flats nearby often walked over there in their slippers for a dip and shower. The Long Street Baths is a safe place for children living on the street to have fun, when they&apos;ve saved up enough money to pay the R35 entry fee. I find it a very accepting place where a great variety of different people can just “be”, whether it&apos;s the pensioner doing an easy back-stroke, newly in-love couples bobbing on a date, free-divers practising holding their breaths, or women swimming in hijabs on a Tuesday morning, which is the reserved time there for female-assigned bodies. So I think municipal pools in South Africa generally have a very relaxed atmosphere. Adele van Heerden, Piscine Suzanne Berloux II, 2023, Ink and Gouache on Drafting Film, 84 x 118cm LO: How has the residency at the Cité helped your career? And would you encourage other artists to do them? AH: Personally, I feel residencies should be about trying new things, developing your practice, and restoring your inner well. During my residency I really tried to be present and as open as possible and really LOOK at things. Many of the lessons I learned on residency could be applied at home. Coming back to Cape Town (where I grew up and lived my entire life) I realised I could teach myself to be in this mindset at home, to look at the city with the eyes of an outsider. I often look for patterns and recurring visual motifs when I&apos;m on residency. A recurring visual seemed to be reflections, in all their forms. The Parisians love putting mirrors everywhere, it creates the illusion of space and light. Shop windows, refractions on top of watery surfaces like puddles after it has rained, the light from the seine refracting onto the buildings around it early in the morning and of course all the beautiful pools each with their own eccentricities. Adele van Heerden, Mirror exhibition, 131A Gallery, photo by Paris Brummer LO: Lastly, are there any exciting projects lined up for 2024 that you are able to share with us? AH: Right now I have a few lines in the water for the next year. My intentions are to focus on making decisions that will help me to keep making art at a prolific level. I&apos;m looking forward to further exploring reflections and fluidity, and collaborating with different creatives, artists and printmaking workshops throughout the year.I&apos;m also planning another residency and an exhibition abroad, so I&apos;m looking forward to moving around again for a bit.

      <title>The Auction Market: Where Culture and Commerce Converge</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/the-auction-market-where-culture-and-commerce-converge</link>
      <description>The Auction Market: Where Culture and Commerce Converge - by Nkgopoleng Moloi --------------- The art market, with its intricate dynamics, allows for convergence between creativity and commerce. Artists and collectors, often mediated by dealers, bring forth their passions, as well as emotional and financial motives. These nuanced and complex motivations can make it difficult to untangle why and how art is bought and sold. Mongezi Ncaphayi, Taleip, Yay!!!, 2024, Mixed media on canvas, 175.5 x 183 cm (unstretched), currently on auction with Strauss &amp; Co - bid here Because of challenges posed by economic uncertainties, artists continuously seek new avenues for engagement as well as ways to participate broadly and firmly in the art market. Art is seen as a viable asset class by many collectors, due to its potential for long-term growth and diversification. For these reasons, the conversation around viable avenues for exchange is a relevant one. Auction houses that make up the secondary market play a pivotal role in facilitating exchange, while also potentially shaping the trajectory of artists&apos; careers by determining the value of artworks. Alastair Meredith, Senior Art Specialist and Auctioneer at Strauss &amp; Co. shares some of the simple and complex reasons why the secondary market exists; “ The reality is people sell artworks for many different reasons, many of which are straightforward. Whether they’re downsizing, selling work they&apos;ve inherited it and are not particularly interested in, or have simply fall out of love with a particular work, they might liquidate parts of their collection. And of course, there are many buyers and collectors in South Africa that take work to market because it&apos;s part of their investment portfolio. Auction houses like Strauss &amp; Co. offer a transparent and simple platform to trade artworks. ” Until recently, I was intimidated by auction houses, for various reasions ranging from negative connotations around flipping (where clients buy work only to auction them off in different markets to chase profits) to opacity around the bidding process as well as questions around the secondary market’s impact on the value of artworks, particularly for living artists. Now, some of these fears are balanced by an understanding of auctions as a potential means for artists to gain exposure, connect with potential buyers, and establish a market value for their works. Louis Maqhubela, Composition with a bicycle, 1970. Private collection. I’ve also had to pause and reflect on my limited interaction with auction houses in South Africa. The first time I made the connection between two wonderful modern masters, Louis Maqhubela and Douglas Portway, was at the RMB Turbine Art Fair in 2019 through the exhibition, “A Meeting of Minds: Louis Maqhubela and Douglas Portway,” which was presented by Strauss &amp; Co. The exhibition attempted to examine the intersection of the work of Maqhubela and Portway, in relation to their art training, early influences, and how their styles developed. This was the third in a series of museum-quality exhibitions staged by Strauss, including JH Pierneef (in 2017) and Irma Stern (in 2018), followed by one of my favourite two-person exhibitions of all time, devoted to Gladys Mgudlandlu and Maggie Laubser. These interventions were important moments for me to critically consider the convergence between curatorial rigour and sales, at a large scale. Through that auction, 32 lots of Mgudlandlu’s works were sold for a combined value of 1.6 million ZAR while Laubser’s sales totalled 94 million ZAR (77% of the lots sold). These results — influenced by an art market that is inherently cyclical and influenced by economic conditions, global events, trends as well as continued inequality, erasure and racialisation — point to both successes and failures of the secondary art market. This of course points to the growing need for diversity and inclusivity that will lead to the recognition of underrepresented artists and increased financial stability for living artists. While I may view the secondary market with scepticism, I’m also aware of the tangible benefits including increased visibility, validation (this too we can complicate), and potential financial returns. By leveraging platforms like auctions, artists can amplify their voices, expand their audiences, and forge meaningful connections within the art market. The resale of artworks on the secondary market can enhance an artist&apos;s reputation and contribute to the narrative surrounding their body of work. By tracking auction results and market trends, younger artists can gain insights into the demand for their art and make informed decisions about their career trajectory. Auctions that offer extensive work can be a good place to connect artworks throughout historical periods. From iconic works by renowned artists canonised through time to contemporary pieces by emerging talents, auctions often showcase a breadth of styles, themes, and perspectives, particularly when these span geographies in terms of countries and regions represented through the artworks. That being said, unlike presentations staged in the primary market through gallery exhibitions and art fairs, there can be some criticism around the absence of a cohesive narrative that contextualises art objects. Maggie Laubser, Landscape with mountains and two birds, South Africa, 1924-28. Courtesy of the Stellenbosch University Collection. For new collectors seeking to navigate the auction scene (particularly those that start at accessible price points), understanding the mechanics of bidding and the avenues for participation is essential. Whether through online bidding, live auctions, or absentee bids (a method of bidding for those who cannot or do not wish to attend an auction), it is possible to engage with auctions in ways that align with one’s comfort levels. While secondary sales present opportunities, like any market, they also harbour complexities, especially when approached irresponsibly. Meredith tells me that pricing requires careful consideration, taking into account factors such as auction precedent, market demand, and the artist&apos;s overall trajectory. He emphasises that collaboration with galleries and industry professionals can help artists navigate these considerations and ensure their works are priced appropriately; “ Pricing artworks on the secondary market is a skill in itself, as it needs to take many factors into account, both regarding the broader market and the artist&apos;s particular situation. And artists, or works of art by artists that still have a gallery presence can be particularly tricky to value for the secondary market .” In cases where competitive bidding processes drive prices beyond initial estimates, this can signal strong demand and increase the perceived value of the artwork. For emerging artists, this can be beneficial if it is used as a benchmark for pricing future work and builds credibility within the art market. It can also be used as a tool for negotiating with galleries or potential buyers, providing tangible evidence of their market. Embracing transparency and collaboration between dealers, artists and auctioneers can empower artists to navigate the complexities of the market while preserving the integrity of their creative practice. Through responsible dealings and interactions, secondary markets can serve as dynamic spaces, where artists, collectors, and enthusiasts can converge around culture through commerce.

      <description>REIMAGINING HERITAGE, ARCHIVES AND MUSEUMS: TODAY/TOMORROW The Institut Français d&apos;Afrique du Sud/French Institute of South Africa (IFAS) and the Embassy of France, with local partners, are hosting the convening Reimagining Heritage, Archives and Museums: Today/Tomorrow at the Homecoming Centre in Cape Town, February 13-15 2024. Themes range from more challenging issues such as funding, restitution, ‘Indigenization’ and collections care and management in an African context to community engagement; contemporary design as heritage preservation; the role of private collectors in heritage, and digital futures. The conference aims to develop a framework for future co-operation projects between France and southern Africa. Ambassador David Martinon, France’s Ambassador to South Africa, Lesotho and Malawi, says: “This dynamic programme was developed through an extensive multi-stakeholder consultation, resulting in a convening that we hope will be a platform for generative conversation, and facilitate new ideas that lead to concrete tools and programmes. We are excited to learn about new projects as well as to showcase our ongoing partnerships between Iziko Museums, the Robben Island Museum and Great Zimbabwe.” A curatorial committee composed of curators Ngaire Blankenberg (Founding Director of the Institute for Creative Repair), Emmanuel Kasarhérou (President of the Musée du quai Branly – Jacques Chirac in Paris), and curatorial assistant Kefiloe Siwisa reviewed over 200 proposals to pull together a programme that seeks to highlight the most urgent issues in the sector. The programme went through multiple rounds of feedback and input from the steering committee, comprising 28 stakeholders, in a collaborative process. &quot;We have prioritised proposals that provide new perspectives on managing and interpreting heritage in 2024 and beyond in (Southern) Africa and also for African collections in French museums. We are looking forward to hearing from the excellent speakers a nd participants how the sector can become more relevant, dynamic and sustainable ’’ says programme curator Ngaire Blankenberg. Panel discussions, roundtables and performances will tackle some of the broader issues that resonate across sectors, while Pecha Kucha sessions will highlight innovative case studies. Concurrent hands-on workshops aim to provide participants with new skills. A dedicated space will showcase immersive digital art, including the notable VR/XR installation, Kwasukasukela , by Inka Kendzia and Xabiso Vili. In addition to the formal convening programme, delegates will have the opportunity to participate in guided tours of Robben Island Museum’s Mayibuye Archives at UWC Campus, Kewpie Daughter of District 6 at District Six Museum, and the Seismography of a Struggle exhibition at Zeitz Mocaa. Registrations for the convening are open, and ticket prices range from R200 (students) to R500, which includes the opening ceremony and the soirée.

      <title>Becoming-Art: Art Trends in 2024</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/becoming-art-art-trends-in-2024</link>
      <description>Becoming-Art: Art Trends in 2024 - by Nkhensani Mkhari ---------- Ian Grose, ZB, 2023, Oil on linen laid on board, 43cmx59cm, from Grose&apos;s solo show &apos;People and Time&apos; Courtesy of Stevenson Gallery The art world in 2024 is poised for a significant shakeup, marked by several key trends emerging from the tremors of 2023. Independent institutions are gaining momentum, offering platforms for diverse voices and solo narratives to take centre stage. Gone are the sterile white cubes; these self-made hubs pulsate with disruptive energy, challenging traditional norms and amplifying the unheard. Within this vibrant landscape, solo exhibitions make a comeback, asking artists to craft poignant narratives with resonance. Their vulnerabilities become shared tapestries, connecting artist and audience through the intimacy of human experience. But 2024 isn&apos;t just about whispers – it&apos;s a whirlwind of emotions. Hypersentimentalism takes hold, echoing the move towards nuanced exploration of intimate experiences within micro-communities. These intricate figurative portraits emerge amidst the algorithmic echo chambers of our social realities, embodying both content and feeling. Citation is back. Forget clean breaks and origin stories whispered in sterile museums. Art&apos;s a tangled thicket, roots snaking back to the roots of other trees, branches intertwined in a riot of colours. Citation isn&apos;t just pointing fingers, It&apos;s about the stutter and stammer, the unfinished sentence, the space between notes where the real music lives. The art world&apos;s buzzword might be &quot;care,&quot; but is it more than talk? The pandemic exposed institutions&apos; shaky foundations, urging a critical look at ethical practices and political implications. But will lofty proclamations bridge the gap to tangible change? We need institutions to shed superficiality and truly embody care, not just discuss it. From shifting power dynamics to embracing real solidarity, the question remains: is the art world ready to walk the walk, not just talk the talk? Self-Instituting: Defying Conventions, Redefining Curatorial Boundaries This past year we saw the rise of independent spaces with the likes of Under Projects, NGO, FEDE amongst others shaping artistic discourse and providing new interdisciplinary collaborations, institutional strategies and models from the periphery. These spaces provided a fresh and nuanced perspective outside of the market. I think this movement towards ephemerality and independence signifies a paradigm shift is underway as artists and curators embark on a journey of self-instituting, challenging the very essence of institutional stability and the art world&apos;s unhealthy obsession with permanence. By questioning the predefined roles of curators and institutions, art workers are embracing the freedom to corrupt expectations. This trend redefines the dynamics between creators and institutions, granting artists greater agency in shaping their narratives and challenging established norms. FEDE x Under Projects ,collaborative showcase, &apos;Fullhouse at blank projects CEC Return of the Solo This past year we saw the return of Solo exhibitions from the group exhibition saturated scene catalysed by the constraints of the COVID19 pandemic. In the ‘thematic renaissance’, solo exhibitions resurge as a platform for artists to amplify their individual narratives. Each manifests as a bespoke odyssey into the artist&apos;s idiosyncratic vision, instigating an intimate discourse between the curator, the artist and the audience. This resurgence not only venerates the singularity of artistic voices but also catalyses a revision of the conventional group exhibition paradigm, fostering a heightened personal entanglement with the artist&apos;s oeuvre. The resurgence of Solo Exhibitions might be a vital respite amid the deluge of social media and image saturation we’re faced with every day. Cinthia Sifa Mulanga&apos;s solo exhibition &apos;Giants&apos; and Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), photography by Anthea Pokroy Hypersentimentalism During a podcast I listened to recently, Artnet&apos;s Kate Brown identified a new trend in the contemporary art scene dubbed ‘Hypersentimentalism’. In my understanding, the enigmatic allure of this movement lies in its meticulous exploration of intimate relationships, finely coded like a video game Easter egg for those who belong to a specific in-crowd or aspire to do so. This wave of figurative portraiture emerges against the backdrop of our algorithmically driven social clusters. These paintings act as both content and sensibility, fostering a deep connection with micro-communities while simultaneously catching the eye of those who may not be privy to the nuanced details. In a world inundated with targeted marketing and online polemics, hypersentimental painting offers an antidote—an ephemeral respite that prompts us to ponder what we truly desire: each other. The desire to showcase quotidian moments and depict those we care for becomes a powerful counterpoint to the fatigue induced by a decade dominated by virtual interactions and digital noise. Now, some might ask, what&apos;s the difference between hypersentimentalism and homage? hypersentimentalism is like a graffitied alleyway, where cryptic murals whisper intimate secrets to the in-crowd. It&apos;s all about those raw, fleeting moments in your chosen family, painted with coded references only you and your crew understand. It&apos;s a middle finger to the digital scroll, a celebration of real connection in a world of virtual noise. Homage, on the other hand, is like a grand cathedral, echoing with the glories of the art world&apos;s past. It&apos;s tipping your hat to the masters, building monuments to their genius with every brushstroke. Think historical context, intellectual engagement, and a legacy that lingers long after the paint dries. Sam Nhlengethwa, Tribute Interior Basquait, Courtesy of The Artists Press New Cites As part of their paracuratorial program for Gabriel Goliath&apos;s solo exhibition Goodman Gallery hosted a conversation between the artist and writer Maneo Mohale. In the conversation a curious current drew my attention: the rising tide of citation. No longer a mere footnote, referencing and recontextualization are blossoming into potent tools, wielded by curators, artists, and audiences alike. For, as Nicolas Bourriaud presaged in his prophetic &quot;Esthétique relationnelle,&quot; contemporary art thrives on porous boundaries, where &quot;everything is potentially relational.&quot; For curators, citation becomes a radical act of inclusivity. Imagine exhibitions not as static tableaux, but as vibrant ecosystems, where past voices whisper through present forms. A Frida Kahlo photograph echoes in a Tony Gum silhouette, sparking dialogues across space and time. The audience, no longer passive observer, becomes an active translator, weaving connections between threads of influence. This porousness dismantles the traditional white cube, inviting marginalized voices to infiltrate the canon, their whispers amplifying into resonant shouts. For artists, citation transcends mere appropriation. It&apos;s a dance of dialogue, a playful borrowing that expands the artistic vocabulary. Think of Bronwyn Katz sculptures, where discarded mattresses sing the blues of forgotten histories, or Billy Langas performances, where colonial narratives are unraveled and rewritten. These artists don&apos;t just reference – they collaborate, sparking conversations that reverberate beyond the gallery walls. Bronwyn Katz, KÄXU-DA (1) (BECOME LOST US) (2019) | Salvaged bedsprings and copper wool, 173 x 138 × 40 cm, courtesy blank projects And what of the audience, once relegated to the velvet rope&apos;s exclusion? With the rise of citation, they become partners in the dance. Armed with smartphones and critical eyes, they trace invisible threads between artworks, unearthing hidden resonances. The echo of a familiar brushstroke in a contemporary canvas ignites a spark of understanding, a shared &quot;aha!&quot; moment that binds artist and viewer in a web of intertextuality. So, as we navigate the art world in 2024, let us embrace the symphony of citation. Let curators build bridges, artists weave tapestries of influence, and audiences become active collaborators. For in this interconnected ecosystem, every reference opens a portal, welcoming new voices to the conversation. Who Cares? The discourse surrounding care, its ethical dimensions, and its political implications has increasingly permeated the art world&apos;s collective consciousness. The global pandemic has not only amplified the urgency of these considerations but has also propelled them to the forefront of our collective reflection. Yet, one must critically examine whether this heightened awareness will catalyze tangible changes in the operational dynamics of our institutions and the fabric of our professional relationships. In scrutinizing the concept of care through a meticulous lens, one is compelled to inquire how a thoughtful exploration of care can furnish transformative responses to the myriad challenges that afflict art institutions. It raises a poignant paradox—why are contemporary art institutions seemingly eager to engage in dialogues about care when, historically, they have been perceived as entities that often operate with a certain carelessness? This query unravels a compelling conundrum: how can an art institution authentically embody and enact the ethos of care, not as a superficial discourse, but as a lived knowledge and a political imperative? In the realm of transformative practices, what methodologies can be employed to bridge the gap between rhetoric and praxis, enabling art institutions to manifest a genuine commitment to care in ways that resonate meaningfully within the intricate fabric of the art world? Arts Collaboratory, AC Ecosystem, drawing by Cráter Invertido, Mexico Forget the stale played out gallery models, old echoes of exclusion, 2024&apos;s art scene hums with a different tune - collaboration and empathy. Solo voices find their chorus, weaving tapestries of connection that resonate beyond sterile white cubes. &quot;Care&quot; isn&apos;t just a buzzword anymore, it&apos;s action. Institutions shed their ivory towers, opening their doors to diverse perspectives that enrich the artistic ecosystem, not just our galleries. Sure, the world&apos;s messy, the dance floor crowded, but a spark of hope shines through. Let&apos;s keep weaving this vibrant future, stitch by stitch, brushstroke by brushstroke. Care is the rhythm, action, the music, and our art, not just a sentimental indulgence but a transformative tool, the radiant glow that lights the way. This year of shared stories and open doors is our canvas, let&apos;s paint a masterpiece of a future, together.</description>

      <title>Post African Futures</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/post-african-futures</link>
      <description>Post African Futures Remembering one of the most important exhibitions of South Africa’s upset 2010s - By Sean O’Toole Muchiri Njenga, Kichwateli 2, 2015, Mixed media installation 2, courtesy Goodman Gallery --------- In the whirlwind time of the Internet, years pass like decades and 2015 was, like, very long ago. Remember 2015? Vaporwave (so much irony, so much pink and purple) was at its nadir. X was still Twitter. Instagram was a mosaic of static impressions. Hito Steyerl had just debuted her immersive video installation Factory of the Sun (2015), a montage of pre-TikTok online dance videos, drone surveillance footage, cheesy gamer graphics and fictitious news, at the Venice Biennale. Bogosi Sekhukhuni was being hailed for his chatbot avatars. And Mxit, well, it died. Amidst all this – let’s summarise it as the unstoppable march of computer mediation of life – Tegan Bristow, a Johannesburg-born artist turned scholar and co-founder of the Fak’ugesi African Digital Innovation Festival, organised the exhibition Post African Futures at Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg. It may well have been one of the most important exhibitions of South Africa’s upset 2010s. Perhaps. We tend to look back at the past with an uneven mixture of astonishment and disdain. What seemed punkish and new at the time now strikes me also as, well, antique, maybe even archaeological – definitely classical. In more formal terms, Post African Futures presented a survey of metropolitan artists from the African continent and its diaspora using digital and technology-orientated art in interesting ways. Many of the participating artists hailed from Johannesburg, Lagos and Nairobi, although not exclusively. Given the remarkable pluralism enabled by digital networks, the exhibition included collaborative works by collectives of like-minded friends. Sekhukhuni collaborated with fellow Johannesburg artists Nolan Oswald Dennis and Tabita Rezaire on an interface work under the guise of their “tech-health” artist group NTU. Pamela Sunstrum and Thenjiwe Niki Nkosi, friends from Johannesburg, presented Notes from the Ancients (The Disrupter X project) , a collab work that was equal parts living installation and leftover prop display. Tabita Rezaire, Still from Deep Down Tidal, 2017, Hd video, 19min Commissioned by Toke Lykkeberg for Citizen X – Human, Nature, And Robot Rights, Oregaard Museum, Den-2, courtesy Goodman Gallery Being a show about what might concisely be termed sci-tech transformations in the making and meaning of art, Post African Futures featured a lot of works in need of electrical cables. Eskom, the state power utility, wasn’t spluttering, which helped ensure that the films and projections by Dineo Seshee Bopape, Sam Hopkins, Emeka Ogboh and Brooklyn J Pakathi, among others, enjoyed an uninterrupted run. Bristow, then a doctoral candidate in Plymouth University in England and teacher in interactive digital media at the Wits School of Arts in Johannesburg, also selected sculptural pieces by Kapwani Kiwanga, Jean Katambayi Mukendi and Muchiri Njenga. These static objects had a decidedly old-school vibe about them in a show burdened by the term Afro-futurism. Lubumbashi-based Mukendi, an electrical engineer by training, showed one of his enigmatic paper-based machines, Migration (2015). Its making drew on skills acquired in his childhood. The artist’s mother worked as a typist and regularly brought home sheets of paper. Mukendi integrated this haptic skill with the teachings of his father about “the DNA of electricity”. “Human energy suffices when it comes to making art,” he said in a 2022 interview . Canadian-born Paris-based Kiwanga, who has family links to Tanzania and will represent Canada at the 2024 Venice Biennale, showed a perforated barrel organ card featuring the transcription of a remote divination ritual by an Ifa priest from Benin. The unfolded card brought to mind Charles Babbage’s proto computers of the 1830s, which could read cards. “My logic is more circular or spiral than binary,” Kiwanga told me shortly after the exhibition. “There’s this question of weaving between times.” Tabita Rezaire, Positive Connect, 2017, courtesy Goodman Gallery The times around 2015 were definitely agitated. Trending hashtags included #RhodesMustFall and #BlackLivesMatter. Filmmaker Laura Poitras, winner of an Academy Award for her documentary Citizenfour about the computer intelligence consultant and whistle-blower Edward Snowden, sued the US government following consistent harassment at U.S. and foreign airports. Also in 2015, scholar Shoshana Zuboff coined the term “surveillance capitalism” in a journal article exploring the “emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere”. Her article was largely about Google. She would consolidate her research into a widely reviewed 2019 book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism . In framing her arguments Zuboff drew on a range of dead social theorists who, in her words, had “struggled to name the unprecedented in their time”. Kapwani Kiwanga, Ifa Organ, 2013, organ paper, courtesy Goodman Gallery This is precisely what Bristow set out to do in her exhibition, albeit substituting theorists for live-wire artists interested in “exploring and being critical about Africa’s cultural relationship to new and communications technologies globally,” as she put it to Kabelo Mnisi. Her choice of artists was prescient, even in 2015. Take Rezaire and Sekhukhuni. Both artists were pushing back against what Rezaire at the time described as the “ occidental hegemony ” of the Internet. “The Internet is such a violent and oppressive space and we have to cope with it,” said Rezaire, who moved to Johannesburg from London in 2014 with a background in economics and filmmaking. “There is much about Internet online protocols and consumer culture that reflects our IRL white reptilian capitalist systems,” said Sekhukhuni in 2017 , shortly after winning the third edition of New York-based digital arts organization Rhizome’s Prix Net Art Award. During the run of Bristow’s exhibition Facebook, now Meta, announced that it would open its first African office in Johannesburg. “Africa matters,” said Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. How and why technology matters to Africans is, however, very different to those presumed by transnational corporations, who are often compelled by westernised assumptions that technology is “a disembodied entity, emptied of social relations,” as anthropologist Bryan Pfaffenberger put it 35 years ago. Far from being a value-free tool or product, wrote Pfaffenberger in an insightful 1988 essay, technology is “a total social phenomenon”. Muchiri Njenga, Kichwateli 2, 2015, Mixed media installation 3, courtesy Goodman Gallery This total phenomenon, which was largely ignored by scholarship around technology in Africa, prompted Bristow to initiate her research project disguised as a public exhibition. In 2017 Bristow completed her doctorate. It is framed by a chewy title but its contents include digestible prose illuminating her motives for making an exhibition. Take this passage about her engagements with South African and Kenyan youth, a generation Bristow characterises as at the forefront of how technological, aesthetic and cultural engagements are being formed in relationship to older African traditions. Tabita Rezaire (centre) at Amakaba, French Guiana, courtesy of the artist “This group are essentially engaging in an ‘act of composition’ that is changing the way African societies define themselves in the state of technological globalisation,” writes Bristow. “Scholarship on Africa fails to contain their context or their intentions, viewing instead the relationship to African traditionalism through the lens of colonial anthropology, or the relationship to technology through the lens of First World development studies.” As I wrote at the outset, 2015 was like nearly a century ago in Internet time. Now is a different epoch. NFTs salted already poisoned digital earth. If 2015 was all about post-Internet art, now is about post-blockchain and A.I. art. It is a different epoch. This is true of the lives of the tight circle of artists who appeared in Post African Futures . Sekhukhuni now lives in Portland, where he cofounded INFANT, a design company interested in “architecture and cognition, planetary affordances, and the onto-epistemological status of science and mathematics”. Bopape and Dennis, while still based in Johannesburg, have an essentially nomadic practice linked to Europe. Ogboh is making astounding sound work from his base in Berlin. And Rezaire has tapped out of the Internet and South Africa. “I am not up to date,” Rezaire told me in a recent Zoom interview from a cacao farm and yoga retreat in her ancestral homeland of French Guiana. “I know nothing about A.I. and can’t talk about it.” As for Bristow, she is now director of education for Diriyah Art Futures, a work-in-progress digital arts centre being piloted by the Ministry of Culture in Saudi Arabia. I reached out to Bristow. With the luxury of time and distance, I asked her, what does she think Post African Futures got right, and wrong? Tegan Bristow, Fakugesi, 2019 On the upside, she says, the exhibition critically recognised the existence of new media and digital arts in Africa, art born from African locations. “I felt like many African contemporary artists challenging this intersection of critical creative practice and technology were being shoved under an ‘Afro-futurist’ umbrella,” says Bristow, referring to the term coined by American literary critic Mark Derry in 1993 and definitively cremated two decades later by artist Martine Syms in The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto . It was “far too generalised” in its application, adds Bristow, and largely wielded as a tool of Euro-American contemporary art gallery set. As to getting things wrong, Bristow says her exhibition was the “first draft” of an idea. “It needed more work and I should have followed with more shows or toured the show internationally. I did not persevere enough to support the position for new media and digital arts.” Fak’ugesi seemed a better place to direct her energies around access to technology and creativity. The festival was anyways a version of Post African Futures , “but operating on the grimy streets rather than in galleries and trying to find ways to support critical practice in more pop culture locations and also support younger artists entering the space,” says Bristow. Artist Natalie Paneng, who earlier this year held her debut solo with Eigen + Art in Leipzig, was a social media intern with Fak&apos;ugesi before she staged a show as a resident artist of the festival. Call it a virtuous circle. Bogosi Sekhukhuni Consciousness Engine 2- absentblackfatherbot, Dual Channel Video Installation, 2014, courtesy Goodman Gallery “I think there is generally much more openness to digital arts,” adds Bristow. “It is mainstreaming pretty hard and I also feel the impact on culture and society is far more visible and therefore there is also interest for critical artistic and cultural engagement.” Buying and collecting digital art is a different matter. “This work is still difficult and unstable in older art collecting models and South / African contemporary art galleries are still trying to figure out its income-generation opportunities. But outside of this there is great work being done in photography, film, VR film and games that shows a significant exploration of A.I. models and new technologies.” But, cautions Bristow, this is occurring in larger, wealthier international contemporary art spaces, film, VR or game communities. “I think the South / African gallery scene is still trying to figure out how to engage and monetise.” Emeka Ogboh Follow Àlà, 2014 2-channel video, stereo sound, courtesy Goodman Gallery One form of engagement, a precursor to buying, is due diligence. Or, as Bertolt Brecht put it in a poem, “ Study the ABC ; it is not enough, but study it!” By which I simply mean, pause and reflect on the long history of digital art and artists in South Africa. Post African Futures , an exhibition located somewhere between the murky beginnings of computer-influenced art and the everything-digital now, is a good place to start.</description>

      <description>Nigeria might be known for its photographic art but the medium has yet to be fully appreciated - By Mary Corrigall The Nlele Institute (TNI), featured photographs, image courtesy the Nlele Institute Obásolá Bamigbola can pinpoint the place and time that he picked up a camera with purpose. This Lagos-based photographer had an affinity for image-making from a young age and when drawing and painting failed to satisfy, it was a camera that resonated with his artistic drive. However, it was when his maternal grandfather died in 2002 and the family travelled to his mother’s home town near Jebba for the funeral that Bambigbola sought out a camera. Hours from his mother’s home village, he knew of a large monument built in honour of Mungo Park, a Scottish explorer, set near the river Niger, which he was determined to visit. He walked there for hours on foot with his cousin in tow. “So I thought myself I would not go to such a place without a camera. So I borrowed a friend&apos;s point-and-shoot film camera.” The images that Bamigbola took of that historical setting, he claims were the first that set him on a course to become a documentary photographer. In Nigeria, however, the path to that endpoint wasn’t so easy to navigate in the absence of an institution that offers formal training for photographers. This forced Bamigbola and others like him to become autodidacts, which was also not without its complications given the dearth of books and information about photography. If Bamigbola had not received a package of seminal books on photography sent by an American photographer based in Canada (brought to Nigeria through a friend), it’s uncertain what his professional outlook might be at present.

This is despite the fact that Nigeria’s visual arts history and contemporary expression are strongly associated with the photographic medium. Think of Okwui Enwezor, the late Nigerian curator, who is often credited with opening up a rich discourse on contemporary African art in Western art capitals. His rise to fame and the assertion of African expression is rooted in the exhibitions he curated of photographic works by Nigerian and other African photographers. These include; In/Sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present ”, Guggenheim Museum, New York (1996), The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945–1994 , Museum Villa Stuck, Munich (2001) and Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography , International Center of Photography, New York (2006). These exhibitions and many others curated by Enwezor and others brought to wider attention the work of many Nigerian photographers such as Oladélé Bamgboye, Andrew Dosunmu, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Samuel Fosso and Iké Udé. In recent years through the efforts of other curators lens-based Nigerian artists such as George Osodi, Andrew Eisebo, Lakin Obubnwo and Akintunde Akinleye have also solidified their names outside their national borders. Many photographers and artists - such as ceramic South African artist Zizi Poswa - credit J.D. &apos;Okhai Ojeikere, known for documenting women&apos;s hairstyles as a leading figure of inspiration.

Fortunately, Uche Okpa-Iroha sought to remedy this dire situation by founding the Nlele Institute in 2013. “His intention was to discover photography talents, develop them and deploy them into a global art scene,” says Bamigbola, who after undergoing a mentorship programme at Nlele Institute, now works for them as the head of special projects and programmes – when he is not busy producing bodies of works and images. Bamigbola has exhibited in Arles, France (2023), the Photo Biennale in Bamako, Mali and the Abuja International Photo Festival.

Image courtesy the Nlele Institute Bamigbola’s work has been circulated at the above-mentioned photo festivals and others due to the Nlele Institute’s objective to expose and present their graduates&apos; work on multiple platforms. This serves to draw attention to the Nlele graduates&apos; work and supports the work of these various African-based photography platforms, which are not only meeting places for photographers from the continent but affirm the value of photography, which perhaps is not as valued as it could be on the African continent or in Nigeria. In Nigeria, this is due to several factors. In the field of journalism, photographs have not historically been a prized part of the storytelling process, according to Bamigbola. Photographers that have done well in Nigeria have been those working for foreign news agencies such as AFP or Reuters or American publications, says Bamigbola. The financial stress on the media caused by the decline in demand for print journalism or news reports due to social media and the internet has had less impact on photographers in Nigeria when compared to South Africa or other regions. For this reason, Nigerian photographers have been motivated to look for opportunities beyond the local newsrooms, says Bamigbola.

Image courtesy the Nlele Institute Exhibiting images in art galleries and other spaces and creating publications has become essential to photographers in light of the above but has its challenges in Nigeria. As has been the case in South Africa, art buyers are not always keen on acquiring photographic works – as they lean more towards traditional mediums such as painting, opting for one-offs, rather than editioned prints, even if they are cheaper. If you take a look at the artists selected to present work by the 10 galleries participating in this year&apos;s edition of Art X Lagos art fair, which has just taken place in Lagos, none are known for lens-based art. This might not be a fair gauge of collector tastes in Nigeria – given this fair has shrunk in size and not all the galleries in that country participated in it – and it is also likely some of these galleries opted to present paintings to recoup the costs of taking part. Nevertheless, it does offer some idea of what kinds of works might be valued by Nigerian collectors. Bamigbola says the uptake of photographers by galleries has been slow. However, Nlele has developed a good relationship with some galleries such as Rele, based in Lagos and Los Angeles in the US. “They are beginning to accommodate photography in their space. Some of our members&apos; work is part of the permanent collection at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Lagos,” observes Bamigbola. He is optimistic as sales for some of the exhibitions staged by their members have been good. “One of our members sold all her works on the opening night and another sold 40% of the works at the exhibition on the opening night,” recalls Bamigbola.

Image courtesy the Nlele Institute Who or on what are young or new photographers in Nigeria training their lenses? There are always new trends, observes Bamigbola with a sigh of regret. He is of the school of thought that photographers should be guided by their knowledge and life experience rather than trends. However, he has observed that many newcomers to the scene are snapping images of religious festivals – of which Nigeria famously has many – and dominated by vibrant dress and performances lend themselves to compelling imagery – before that street photography was all the rage. In many of these instances, the photographers have little knowledge or understanding of the communities that they are photographing – Bamigbola calls such photographers “tourists.” Photographers have to find their own voice and subject matter and immerse themselves in it, he advises. He has been photographing traditional practices of the Yoruba for three years now “as an insider.” Religious events offer only a small window into a wider picture, he suggests. “The event is only a layer of the body of work. You have to understand the what, why, where and how,” This is part of the journalistic practice that is taught at the Nlele Institute. Photographing with a clear intention in mind should be an objective, urges Bamigbola. The proliferation of photographic images that define our age, due to social media and cameras in cellphones - has heightened the value of this objective - the intentional image. Where once photographers spent more time getting their heads around the technology, advances in the tech have freed them up to take images with more purpose. “Critical thinking is one of the most important skills for a photographer and that is what separates an artist from a hobbyist, critical thinking. You have to train your mind and shoot with purpose” says Bamigbola. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based art writer, researcher and consultant.</description>

      <title>Speaking Art’s Language</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/speaking-art-s-language</link>
      <description>Speaking Art’s Language - by Timothy Gawaya Photo: © Sarah Cascone. Comedian by Maurizio Cattelan on display at Art Basel Miami, 2019. Courtesy Artnet News. Contemporary art is often criticised for its gradual abandonment of visual coherence in favour of the abstract. This is a common point with which we are all intimately familiar, namely, that much of what is considered ‘art’ today does not make much sense – that a toddler, or even an ape, could’ve splashed a few dollops of paint on a canvas. A long standing charge levelled against artists is their tendency to complicate, or perhaps blur, understandings of artistic merit. People incredulously ask how such and such can be art when it so clearly is, say, a large monochromatic canvas, a urinal, a banana duct-taped to a wall, or a JPEG of an ape. Those who encounter works in art galleries, exhibition catalogues or online and wish to decipher the visual cues with which they are faced instinctively turn to the text. One would imagine that a descriptive essay should elaborate on how and why this piece with which I am presented qualifies as a work of art. Turning to the text becomes a vestige of salvation, a final hope that things may become less muddled. After all, writing is, in some regards, the conveyance of information. Such that it makes sense that, in a situation where my eyes deceive me, I can turn to the other’s words for clarity. However, text descriptions accompanying artworks are notorious for their obscurantism and verbosity, often tangentially relating to the works in whose service they claim to be working. The language tends to be highbrow and academic, fond of technical jargon (‘positionality’, ‘non-spatial’, ‘entropic’ etc.), totally unwilling to speak in clearer terms. A specialist’s language. In either case, whether apprehending the artwork or its descriptive text, we are left asking: … what? Photo: Titled (Art as Idea as Idea) [Nothing in English], 1968, by Joseph Kosuth. Courtesy Buffalo AKG Art Museum. In other words, contemporary art’s pretentious dimensions have expanded to include its explanations. This is art because it is art: we’re trapped in a tautological circle. Not only could a child have produced this, but words used to mean things, you know. The greater the waffle, the worse the art; right? ‘International Art English’ (IAE) was coined a decade ago by Alix Rule and David Levine to describe a sort of ubiquitous art writing that “has everything to do with English, but [is] emphatically not English.” Rule and Levine attempted to account for the peculiar language seen in press releases, artist’s statements, and gallery texts. Per their argument, contemporary art writing lavishes in obscure language that has ceased being informative and become ornamental. Power and authority are at play here; IAE demands recognition: “Authority is relevant [...] because the art world does not deal in widgets. What it values is fundamentally symbolic, interpretable [...] The ability to evaluate—the power to deem certain things and ideas significant and critical—is precious.” The main takeaway is that IAE, or artspeak, has a function that forgoes information: “the goal is to evoke preconfigured conceptions or emotions about art in the reader”. In so many words, artspeak encourages us to ask less what the text means, and more how the text looks. Deliberately emphasising form over function highlights the removal of art from wider society, enclosing it in the confines of the select few. It might be the case that artistic texts as they exist in their ornamental form maintain and perpetuate socio-cultural stratification. Once artists, writers, and other cultural producers retreat into ornamental obfuscation, the grounds for an effective politicisation of aesthetics become obsolete. IAE invents the layperson as much as the specialist through exclusive means often dictated by access to higher education and cultural institutions. Decoding the text is analogous to decoding one’s position in a social hierarchy. Photo: © David Shrigley. Stop It by David Shrigley, 2007. Tate. Courtesy Tate Modern In this sense, IAE reveals as much about your own background and upbringing as it does about the state of contemporary art. Artspeak, like the gallery form, is a successful export that evades all forms of meaningful critique by incorporating politically-subversive rhetoric and anticipating its usage. As Hito Steyerl notes, IAE’s emphasis on ornament “is an accurate expression of social and class tensions around language and circulation within today’s art worlds and markets: a site of conflict, struggle, contestation, and often invisible and gendered labour.” Speaking art’s language is essentially saying nothing while laying claim to everything. The tension between elaborating art’s politicised dimensions while adhering to the stylistic confines of IAE effectively nulls any critical gestures. IAE is the language of art in its commodity form, allowing us to seem more profound than we actually are. It provides us with the vocabulary for critiquing repressive systems, yet in turn represses our ability to envision art worlds untethered to movements of capital. Take the following example: [This exhibition] seeks to be a pulsating nerve centre through which the artist embraces a looming metamorphosis of self. Broaching from long standing ouvre [ sic ] marked by theme attractions [ sic ] around mental wellness and self-portraiture, [the artist] exhibits a body work [ sic ] that bids farewell to an ego whose gravitational core is in the past whilst simultaneously beckoning a new horizon in which a new version of selfhood is in waiting. A surface-level effort at subversive rhetoric accompanies layers of literary concealment. In effect, the above exemplifies IAE’s mutation of linguistic norms: the text masks the emptiness at the root of its statements through flowery language. IAE alienates general audiences as much as it alienates art from its potential as serving political transformation. The inseparability of art and politics makes questioning IAE all the more worthwhile. If, for example, we have a highly-politicised art that speaks in a specialist’s language, what does it suggest about the efficacy of resisting and reevaluating the strenuous effects of capital? Is it only a matter of decrying things outwardly, while remaining inwardly content with the status quo? Simply put, should we maintain the cynic’s cool distancing, congratulating ourselves with smug analysis at the expense of effective action? Art that exists in commodity form can only outline potential channels of escape, as opposed to a total revaluation of an oppressive system. And artforms that rely on IAE can only lead us so far in our search for a less exploitative regime. Notes: Exhibition text: ‘Pride Comes Before The Fall’.

      <title>Developing a more sustainable curatorial practice with RMB Latitudes CuratorLab</title>

      <description>Developing a more sustainable curatorial practice with RMB Latitudes CuratorLab - by David Mann ---------- Curating in the African context is rarely a singular pursuit. In South Africa, as is the case across much of the African continent, interest in curatorial practice is high, while sustainable opportunities and platforms for curators remain slim. As such, many contemporary curators adopt the hybrid, hyphenated modes of “artist-writer-curator”, pursuing curation part-time or whenever the opportunity arises. CuratorLab 2023 participant Denzo Nyathi in conversation at RMB Latitudes Art Fair CuratorLab, an initiative by Latitudes in partnership with Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) , emerges out of this set of conditions and predicaments, and attempts to provide new ways of developing and sustaining curatorial practice on the African continent. Launched in 2021 alongside its partner programme, ArtistLab, the inaugural CuratorLab programme took the form of a facilitated online residency for nine South African curators – one from each province. The idea was to offer both practical experience in the industry and the opportunity to hone conceptual curatorial skills. Participants were able to plan and conceptualise their own exhibition which is hosted on Latitudes Online, work directly with the artists in their show, and also gain experience in the commercial aspect of the industry, earning commission on sales. The second iteration of the programme, which took place in early 2023, saw RMB joining as a partner of CuratorLab, building on its longstanding RMB Talent Unlocked initiative, an intensive skills development and arts mentorship experience. The call was extended to participants across the African continent, yielding curators from Nigeria, Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Ghana, and South Africa. Speaking on the partnership with Latitudes for the CuratorLab programme, RMB’s Carolynne Waterhouse explains that, when looking at the African arts ecosystem, there’s a clear lack of curators from the continent, largely owed to a lack of sustainable platforms and institutions. “Curators are essential in that they have the ability to look at the artistic and socio-political landscape – to be in touch with the times, to be in conversation with the world and with that arts landscape,” says Waterhouse. “So, it’s important that we have a diverse range of curators who are able to represent the tone and the spirit of the times, but it’s as important that we have systems in place to support that work.” Essential to the programme is the role of mentorship. Since its inception, CuratorLab, has been driven by Nina Carew, Latitudes’ In-House Curator, and Head of Special Projects and Platform, who’s mentored each CuratorLab participant. In addition to the programme’s outcomes of a planned, conceptualised exhibition for each participant, Carew saw it as imperative to build professional practice resources and frameworks into the residency. “I believe CuratorLab offers both skills development within a robust curatorial framework and practical training,” says Carew. Participants were offered weekly sessions to develop core curatorial principles, as well as one-on-one mentorship by established curators in the industry, weekly check-ins with Latitudes curators, and review sessions to critique their exhibition proposals. “Furthermore, we offered central resources for professional practice which included video and reading material, a handbook on key materials and practice guides to core strategies such as curatorial conception, consignment agreements and budgeting.” RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2023 The process has yielded a number of accessible and engaging exhibitions that manage to grapple with grand, universal narratives, anchored by personal experiences. These include Visions of Transcendent Corporalities , Translating Home , What Shapes Us? Makes Us? Guides Us? , and Black Existence as Black Resistance among others. “We can see that emerging curators are grappling with deeply intimate questions related to self-identity and broader questions on the human condition. This may not necessarily be a change or trend, but it does reveal a strong affinity to define, whether that be personally or politically, what it means to be African,” says Carew. Talya Lubinsky, Marble Dust , 2020, installation, presented by Chelsea Selvan For 2023, RMB Latitudes CuratorLab participant Denzel “Denzo” Nyathi, whose painting-centric show, Intimate Histories , looked at, among other things, lived experience as a way of engaging with historical and contemporary narratives, the programme was both the impetus for a curatorial journey and a platform that continues to open up opportunity in the realms of curatorial practice. RMB Latitudes CuratorLab 2023 participants “Curation, as a strictly professional activity, is greatly impacted by decisions made as ‘far away’ as the national treasurer’s office,” says Nyathi. “But the curatorial, as the philosophical underpinnings of curating as we typically understand it, is bound by nothing… there’s a freedom and responsibility in the curatorial to go further.” For Intimate Histories , Nyathi allowed the concept to be shaped by conversations with artists, using the resultant reflections and experiences as points of departure. “Sounding out my ABCs alongside art advisors, writers, museum professionals, the artists and my cohort of curators was just my ideal kind of learning environment,” says Nyathi. Still, beyond the production of conceptually rich and engaging exhibitions, there are other markers of success to be considered. Are the shows selling? Are participants leaving the programme better equipped to navigate the industry? Andre Rose, That I May Hope , 2021, presented by Bontle Tau Over its two iterations, CuratorLab has garnered close to 600 applications, from which 20 participants have been selected, trained and presented with the platform to curate their own exhibition. This all works out to around 130 artists, and 310 individual artworks exhibited. According to Carew, exhibitions from both the 2021 and 2023 programmes continue to make sales. For Waterhouse, it’s essential that the platform supports and sustains the artist and the curator. Until the artist has sold, or the curator has successfully put together an exhibition and been paid, the programme hasn’t been successful, she says. “So, it’s about recognising, attracting, nurturing and rewarding artistic talent. Platforms like CuratorLab become vital in that they help develop necessary networks and systems of support for curators.” Many of the past participants continue to work actively as curators. Since participating in RMB Latitudes CuratorLab 2023, Nyathi has gone on to work with Latitudes again for the RMB Latitudes Art Fair, which later lead to a permanent role in a sales and curatorial capacity. More recently, he’s worked as a curatorial assistant for the Lagos-based gallery 16/16 for FNB Art Joburg. CuratorLab 2023 participant Denzo Nyathi in conversation at RMB Latitudes Art Fair After participating in the 2023 programme, Boitumelo Makousu took her show O Mang, O tswa kae, O ya Kae? to Con Hill as a physical exhibition. Makousu has since gone on to join the Latitudes team as Platform &amp; Production Administrator, as has 2021 participant Chelsea Selvan who, in addition to working towards an upcoming solo exhibition as part of her 2022 Absa L’Atelier win, now heads up Latitudes’ marketing and editorial department. Further examples of RMB CuratorLab alumni are the ceramic artist Carina Capitine who has subsequently embarked on a residency in Angola through Nesr Art Foundation, and Motheo Mamabolo who’s taken her curatorial skills to the realm of film through the founding of an independent film club. Tebogo Losaba, Umkhozi , 2022, presented by Motheo Mamabolo The need to identify and support emerging curators remains. As programmes like RMB CuratorLab endure, the hope is that they’re able to better identify the shifting challenges and possibilities of contemporary curation in Africa, and adapt accordingly. In this way, they will come to serve as a record and a reflection of shifting contemporary curatorial practices. “...Curating on the continent has entailed institution building – not necessarily driving discussions about art or commissioning artists,” writes Mary Corrigall in a recent article on the relationship between curators and art fairs . “Which is why many African curators tend to leave the continent to pursue careers elsewhere. For those that remain here, they make the best of opportunities that come their way.” Ideally, through programmes such as RMB CuratorLab, these opportunities will continue to grow, providing curators with the tools, training, and possibility to share their ways of seeing with the continent, the world. As Carew puts it: “In my opinion, the role of a curator on the continent is fundamentally linked to storytelling; in line with the Latin origin ‘curatus’, ‘to care for’ one or another&apos;s stories. Now more than ever, there is interest, resource and capacity for Africans to narrate and curate their own stories to a local and global audience.”</description>

      <title>Curator&apos;s Journal: On Independent Cultural Production in Johannesburg</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/curators-journal-on-independent-cultural-production-in-johannesburg</link>
      <description>Curator&apos;s Journal: On Independent Cultural Production in Johannesburg - by Nkhensani Mkhari ------------ © OtherNetwork, photo: Thabang Radebe Before I go on, allow me to say as pertinent as it may be, this essay doesn&apos;t seek to be a survey or draft a conventional map of the Independent Cultural practices in Johannesburg - we’ll save that for a longer text; rather, it serves as reflection on the impetus of independent cultural production in Johannesburg through my personal experiences over the past several years. Lately I’ve been reflecting on how every September since I got to Johannesburg, I’ve been frequently confronted by how within the intricate terrain of South Africa&apos;s art ecology, the independent cultural production sphere often finds itself eclipsed by the hegemonic force of the booming commercial art world. A pervasive obscurity ensues, primarily stemming from the glaring deficiency of financial patronage or state support, a circumstance that relegates these vital spaces to a precarious existence with an average longevity barely reaching 2 to 3 years, while languishing in extended periods of dormancy. My entanglement with this discourse was catalysed by an invitation to participate in a panel on Independent Cultural Production featuring Sinethemba Twalo of the imitable NGO (Nothing Gets Organized) and Mpho Moshe Matheolane, art historian and Think Doctoral Fellow. The panel was convened by OtherNetwork , a digital collaborative platform connecting independent art spaces globally, initiated by COOKIES and ifa. Hosted within the evocative confines of The Library of Things We Forgot to Remember , an initiative birthed in 2017 by the visionary Zimbabwean artist, Kudzanai Chiurai. My initiation into the world of Independent cultural production was a whirlwind affair, a rendezvous with the avant-garde Pool Space tucked away downtown on the corner of the ground floor of Ellis House back on the auspicious evening of March 15, 2015. The alchemical collision of minds behind this exhibition: Mandla Mlangeni - Jazz extraordinaire - and maestro of melodies, Shane Cooper, visionaries in their own right. This exhibition was woven into a series christened Starter Room. Sitting on the floor, back against the wall, a playground of experimentation and médiathèque marvels unfurled before me. Picture it: an audiovisual dialogue reimagining of plant relations, structures, and substrates, all conscripted into service as fertile terrain for the serendipitous dance of the poetic, the social, the political, and the biological.Whispers of untold narratives and clandestine forms of enlightenment beckoned us forth carried along a resonant bassline. Plunging us headlong into the hitherto unheard and the wholly unexpected. Now, let me set the scene – I was a fresh arrival to Johannesburg, a neophyte in the &apos;artworld&apos;, still grappling with the throbbing pulse of this vibrant metropolis. But that evening, at Pool Space, I was bewitched. On my way to grab some drinks with friends afterwards, I felt my preconceptions of artistic production and perceptions of artistry itself dissolve and transmogrify. That night breathed life back into my capacity to dream. I kept visiting show after show and my network expanded, leading me to connect with more independent project spaces and collectives in the city. Something that left an indelible mark on my artistic sojourn to these spaces and gatherings was the distinction in the audience&apos;s makeup from the white cube galleries uptown – for these soirées predominantly unfolded within the inner city&apos;s embrace – a palpable sense of community, a camaraderie that I continued to see thrive within these hallowed creative sanctuaries. Here, human connection reigned supreme; people actually saw one another and engaged in the raw essence of each other&apos;s lives. There was a deep sense of warmth and belonging. The strength of these spaces was the strength of the community. MADEYOULOOK Kassel 2022 Photo: Frank Sperling Whether it was a gathering hosted by the enigmatic MADEYOULOOK, the anarchic fervour of Nothing Gets Organized, the subversive spirit of Keleketla, the playful rebellion of Bubblegum Club, the conceptual brilliance of Wherewithall, or the soul-stirring resonance of Lapa, a common thread ran through the fabric of the spaces these entities created. An unmistakable aura of the avant-garde and the underground pervaded the air, where artistic expression flowed without the constraints of commodification pressures that plague mainstream art. In this sphere, the boundaries of the independent cultural production space extended limitlessly, fuelled by an inexhaustible creative engine propelling us toward an audacious future, an alternative portrait of what South African contemporary art can be and, indeed, what it already is. © OtherNetwork, photos: Thabang Radebe So, when I stumbled upon the work of MADEYOULOOK at Documenta 15 last year titled ‘Mafolofolo’ I felt a deep resonance. ‘Mafolofolo’ emerges as a sanctuary of recovery, born from years of unwavering research. The project delves into the intricate web of loss and the subsequent resurgence entwined with the land&apos;s very soul. Traversing the tumultuous epochs of South Africa&apos;s history, ever persistent and destabilising, to unearth the enduring bonds that tie us to this sacred earth. The floor installation served as both a site of mourning and a haven for contemplation, an offering of strategies to mend the broken threads of existence. The unending cycle of displacement and return is etched into the very fabric of this space. The resonance of sound, an ode to the African resistance songs that echoed across the land, particularly in the battle for emancipation and autonomy against the dominions that strived to stifle our soul&apos;s fervor. This work offered a glimpse of hope—a chance for new imaginaries of connection with the land, an opportunity to transcend the shackles of the past and forge a path towards a different, more profound communion. However, I kept thinking about how beneath the veneer of this mega show, Europe stands as an active crime scene, a place where Africans were forcibly transmuted into colonial subjects. With the weight of this thought in mind, the artworks on display became a testament to the complex web of simulacra that facilitated this transmogrification. This tension, one not confined solely to the political frictions that unfurled at Documenta 15, resided in the sobering reality that those whom the work spoke of may never experience it, imprisoned as it is within the confines of European borders. And so, the conundrum persists. This thought raised a pivotal question—could the issue at hand transcend location and instead revolve around the dearth of events akin to Biennales and Triennials within South Africa? This vacuum results in our culture being exported without us ever bearing witness to its unfolding, even though we’re integral to its immanence. The pressing query for cultural practitioners, curators, directors, and critics is how to craft a sustainable way to bridge this chasm? With our best talent often moving abroad, or seeking refuge and belonging beyond our borders, perhaps the echoes of our identity, commodified before being relinquished to us, will stir change or fall on deaf ears. In the panel discussion the query of how can we harness the crucible of South Africa&apos;s burgeoning independent cultural production loomed large: how do we carve out the necessary space to harness its vitality and counterbalance the relentless sway of commercial interests that presently dictate the narrative? OtherNetwork aspires to forge connections and facilitate idea-sharing among such talents and the spaces they occupy globally. Yet, the challenge remains—how do we nurture these local spaces and the curators and artists who inhabit them, ensuring their sustainability and expanding their influence to reach broader audiences? I proposed a strategy I often use; Parasitic Mutualism. A symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. This idea is inspired by the pioneering work of Post Brothers and Chris Fitzpatrick in their seminal text A Productive Irritant:Parasitical Inhabitations in Contemporary Art which was inspired by Michel Serres The Parasite . Serres contends that the parasite, often seen as a negative or harmful entity, plays a crucial role in ecosystems by contributing to their complexity and stability. He suggests that parasites are not just destructive but also serve as agents of transformation and adaptation. Daringly, he proposes that all relationships are fundamentally parasitical. Definitions of the parasite: To one side of (para) the location of the event (site) – the medium or being through which communication must pass. The ‘static’ that interrupts the transmission of a message. The uninvited guest or ‘social’ parasite. A living organism that takes without giving as it infects its hosts The one who is always near to food, close to the meat A thermal exciter, that which catalyses the system to a new equilibrium state Parasitic strategies are, at heart, a revolt of the creative spirit—an arsenal of critique and subversion. They can serve as a formidable tool wielded by artists in their quest to dismantle entrenched norms, question institutional authorities, and shatter the barriers of the status quo. By infiltrating the hallowed halls of existing spaces and systems, artists and curators can illuminate the oft-overlooked fault lines in our social, political, and cultural landscapes, compelling society to confront its own reflection. This isn&apos;t art held captive within gallery walls; it&apos;s art thrust into/from the raw and unanticipated spaces of public discourse, sparking discussions on the intersection of public ownership, the sacred realm of creative expression, and the relentless commodification of artistic ingenuity. By disrupting the established systems and spaces, parasitical mutualism can awaken us from the slumber of complacency and the jaws of excessive aesthetic acculturation contributing to cultural homogenization—both within the confines of the art world and in the broader realm of societal norms. They serve as a stark reminder that art isn&apos;t confined to mere aesthetics; it&apos;s a dynamic force that challenges the entrenched paradigms, paving the way for transformation. Ultimately, parasitical strategies invite us to reenvision the boundless possibilities of art ecology. They liberate creativity from its predictable confines, beckoning a spirit of experimentation and innovation that resonates with artists and audiences alike. While strategies such as these may at times dance on the edge of controversy and confrontation, their enduring productivity lies in their capacity to ignite vital conversations, kindle social engagement, and elevate artistic expression beyond the confines of the expected to the extraordinary. Keleketla! Library, Skaftien#4: A Reprise of Fires, Johannesburg, South Africa, 2022, Courtesy Keleketla! Library As the curtain falls on this essay, I feel we&apos;ve delved deep into the resilient heart of Johannesburg&apos;s independent cultural scene, a gritty underdog grappling with the overpowering grip of the commercial art behemoth. Through my personal voyage and musings, we&apos;ve celebrated the tight-knit community and rebellious spirit thriving within these underground sanctuaries, where artistic expression refuses to be tamed by the relentless market forces. We&apos;ve also pondered the unsettling reality of our culture&apos;s exportation, leaving us as spectators to our own narrative. In this provocative mix, the concept of Parasitic Mutualism emerges as a disruptive strategy, a call to arms for artists to challenge conventions and ignite conversations. It&apos;s a clarion call to imagine a future where independent cultural production not only survives but thrives, injecting a much-needed dose of dynamism into Johannesburg&apos;s artistic tapestry and the broader cultural discourse.</description>

      <description>Is abstraction the route to escaping geography and gender? - By Mary Corrigall -------- Nada Baraka in studio, courtesy of the artist You have to resist the urge to neatly locate Nada Baraka’s art in an Egyptian context. The thirty-three-year-old artist was born in Cairo, and lives and practices there and indeed the sense of chaos that defines the compositions of her abstract paintings could represent the erosion of democratic values, political order and worsening social conditions. However, two qualities of her art stand in the way of geographically defining it. Not only did her time living in London shift her language and set her on the path she is on now, but her interpretation of the body in her art resonates with how many high-profile female artists – from Christina Quarles to Wangetchi Mutu, to Louise Bonnet – are representing the female form. Yet it would also be an oversimplification of Baraka’s art to zone in on qualities that it might share with other female artists. She does not directly depict the female form, albeit her treatment of the body in her art – as distorted and disembodied – denies objectification, and the male gaze, and aligns with how female artists are representing it. Chiming in with current attitudes where gender fluidity is being advanced, the human body in her art is genderless. She was recently named the winner of the ANNA Award, which is focused on celebrating female-identifying artists. She is, of course, delighted to have won this award, which has brought her to the attention of South African collectors and she counts herself as fortunate to have entered the art landscape at a time when there is heightened interest in supporting female artists. “History wasn&apos;t kind to females in the past. A lot of very good and interesting female artists never had the chance to exhibit or develop their work because they weren&apos;t even a part of the art scene. They struggled a lot. The fact that everything is online means you can&apos;t really hide, you can&apos;t be unfair because the world will know. This is a great power that we have now,” says Baraka via Google Meet from Cairo. Nada Baraka, Ghost in the attic, 2021, acrylic and oil on canvas, SOLD The celebration of female artists hasn’t necessarily changed realities on the ground, she adds. “In the day-to-day life, of course, there is a lot of inequality and harassment. It&apos;s a man&apos;s world.” She completed her undergraduate degree in fine art in Cairo, but, significantly, she was based in London for the two years it took her to do a master&apos;s at Central Saint Martins. Cairo may be steeped in ancient visual culture, but in London Baraka had time to soak up the abundance of contemporary art that flows through this vital Western art capital. “There are hundreds of galleries, and exhibitions happening everywhere (in London). It was mind-blowing, the art was super diverse. Because a lot of the museums had retrospectives, I got to see an artist’s full body of work and development,” recalls Baraka. This was in stark contrast to the contemporary art scene in Cairo, which deteriorated since the revolution, says Baraka. “We have only two or three institutions, and there is one major commercial gallery where most of the artists exhibit. The scene in Egypt is very limited.” The British artist Francis Bacon had an impact on Baraka – she frequently saw his paintings while living in London. You can trace this influence in her painting – her treatment of the body – as a contorted and atomised form. However, as is often the case with artists her art is the result of a confluence of visual inspirations that are melded, formed and manifest innately. Nada Baraka in studio, courtesy of the artist “I start working without having a plan. I don&apos;t do (a preliminary) sketch and I don&apos;t know what the outcome of the artwork is going to be,” she observes. This process no doubt guarantees the sense of disordered chaos that defines her paintings. This characteristic could be a reflection of life in Egypt. “It&apos;s very chaotic here. In Egypt, there are no rules. Life is not easy in Egypt but at the same time, you get to experience so much because you can do anything here,” she observes. Baraka, however, ascribes this sense of chaos in her art to her interest in depicting violence. Unexpectedly, the sense of disruption and turmoil she evokes is softened by her chosen palette, of pastel shades. Pinks, yellows, and warm welcoming tones infuse her paintings. Baraka believes that this contrast or unexpected juxtaposition is drawn from her love of animated films and TV shows, which she has long admired. Tom and Jerry captured her imagination, particularly in how violence is represented via cute animal characters in appealing feminine colours, which somehow obscures the true nature of the gruesome acts they commit. Fortunately, her experience of direct violence appears to be limited to watching cartoons. However, there are significant events in her life that have forced her to consider the fragility of the human body. Nada Baraka, Fission series 1, 2022, €270 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Her cousin’s experience with muscular dystrophy was the inspiration for one of her art projects. “It&apos;s a very difficult disease to live with. All of your muscles keep eating your body until you can’t walk, move, eat or swallow,” says Baraka. These experiences might well account for the distorted body parts or organic forms that recur throughout her work, hinting at a body turning on itself. Indeed, her paintings could depict a diseased body from the inside, as Baraka also shares that she is interested in worlds within worlds. There is a surreal vibe to her paintings, though recognisable objects such as light bulbs or ladders anchor images replete with floating organic forms, which evoke, plants, underwater creatures or body parts. Architectural lines – hinting at interior spaces or buildings – tend to frame these abstract and expressive forms, loosely suggesting domestic narratives, or perhaps chaos versus structure binaries or taken further male versus female – read in the juxtaposition between the angular and organic forms. The abstract turn in her art manifested after her time in London, but she is unable to pinpoint the precise influences that led her to shift in this direction. What is certain is that when she returned to Cairo in 2015 she was on her way to developing her art, a signature even, that was identifiable but also resonated with collectors from the Middle East who gravitated to the most prominent gallery in that city – Gypsum. It has carved out an international reputation through its participation in high-profile art fairs such as Art Basel and Frieze London. Baraka has shown two solo exhibitions at this gallery – Cosmic Truths and Tales to be Told in 2019 and Land of Sequels in 2021. Baraka’s next art exhibition sees her adopting an entirely different approach to her gallery shows and with paintings that are self-consciously grounded in a location, and space. She is along with other artists making artworks in response to her late grandfather’s archive. The project is collaborative, installation and site-specific based and motivated not only by Baraka’s personal history but a need to create alternative spaces for artists in a city with few opportunities for artists. Nada Barka, Withstanding the vagaries , 2019 The exhibition is set in her grandfather’s apartment in Cairo, which has been preserved since his death. It houses his extensive collection of photographs, maps and plans (he worked in the Ministry of Irrigation) and other ephemera. He appears to have been meticulously archiving his life, and interests. “My grandfather was a very good archivist. I think we might have ruined his archive because we didn&apos;t understand it in the beginning. Everything from like the smallest silliest things, to the important documents (were stored). He was very articulate. He did everything, himself. He took and developed his own photographs.” No matter how precise and ordered Baraka’s grandfather&apos;s archives might be, beneath his structured approach to mapping his life there must have been messy details, unfinished narratives and contradictions. With her characteristic approach to her expression, no doubt Baraka will draw these qualities to the surface.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/fuzzy-disciplines-artistic-collaboration-in-south-african-fashion-design</link>
      <description>Fuzzy disciplines: Artistic collaboration in South African fashion design - by Chloë Reid Sketch 22, Something Good Studio x Maja Maljević, px centred studio 10 “I’ve had people approach me saying ‘I had no idea you made paintings as well as socks’”, says Olivié Keck, a Cape Town-based artist who has worked on a number of projects in which her artworks have been translated into what she calls “wearables” - socks by Feat . , scarves by L’MAD and the Norval Foundation, and masks with Sho Madjozi. While collaborations between artists and fashion, furniture or homeware designers are not uncommon in South Africa, there remains some confusion and even skepticism around the extent to which the disciplines of contemporary art and design can and should overlap. Zydia Botes of Something Good Studio , who collaborates with artists to produce blankets, throws and rugs, sums up misconceptions within the design industry saying,“You won’t believe how often I get the question: “So what do you use the blanket for?” Olivié Keck, Ophelia Forever | Scarf, R 2,300.00 ex. VAT, BUY NOW Within the South African art space, this ‘confusion’ occasionally reflects archaic divisions between functional and decorative design and the higher intellectual or conceptual status of ‘Fine Art’. “There’s a difference between collaborating with Nike and collaborating with, say, Whiskers,” suggests Olivié Keck, “but I think it’s actually an intellectual or academic argument rather than a real-world consequence. Maybe people will think that putting your work on a sock undermines the intellectual value of your ‘oeuvre’, but at the end of the day, a lot of your ability to grow is just getting your work into the world. People don’t buy a painting and then walk around with it.” Artist Io Makandal considers that “the South African art space seems to want to hold onto these boundaries, but it’s so market driven, it doesn’t really make sense. I produce drawings very much in order to survive and to be able to support other kinds of work that I make, and that&apos;s just the kind of reality within which we work here. I appreciate collaborations with designers because they help towards more experimental projects in my art practice. Then again, I also sometimes feel self-conscious thinking, ‘how is everyone else reading this?’” Shakil Solanki for FIELDS, Credits: Designer: Mikael Hanan, Stylist: Studio Degens, Photographer: Ian Engelbrecht, Model: Aaron Zeederberg “Enough people have actually told me, I’d rather frame the scarf and hang it in my home as opposed to wearing it or putting it on my bag,” remarks artist Shakil Solanki, referring to silk scarves produced in collaboration with L’MAD , “that’s really left to the discretion of the buyer, but it’s another kind of charm that can come into play through this type of project.” Ornamentation and adornment is an integral part of Solanki’s practice and likely accounts for the ease with which he has collaborated with designers including L’MAD, Sindiso Khumalo and most recently, the contemporary menswear brand, FIELDS . “There’s often a sense of fabric or pattern or textile that runs through my work, which makes the process of collaborating with brands like L’MAD, FIELDS and Sindiso Khumalo feel really special.” Solanki first collaborated with Sindiso Khumalo when Khumalo was developing a collection for Milan fashion week as a winner of the international LVMH 2020 prize . Solanki referenced botanical drawings in developing images of cotton flowers, which Khumalo translated into patterns. According to Solanki, “the collection drew inspiration from Harriet Tubman and her legacy,” an extension of what Khumalo describes as an interest in “...representations of Black women and women of colour at the turn of the 20th century” with a focus on “portraiture of both African and African American women during this time.” Roly Poly, Olivié Keck, Feat. Socks, Courtesy of the artist This was a very positive first experience for Solanki, who emphasised Khumalo’s attention to detail in her designs and transparent approach to the collaboration. “She was a pleasure to work with,” he says. Transparency, fairness and mutual respect are qualities that set these projects apart. Of her experience working on a silk scarf with L’MAD, Io Makandal says, “It was all very transparent. They had a clear agreement where they pay you for your work and then you receive a percentage from each sale”. Something Good Studio, Romaria and FIELDS take great care in sourcing their materials and manufacturing locally. All of the designers mentioned in this piece work closely with artisans and makers, prioritising natural and/or recycled materials and producing high-quality items at a small scale or with limited editions. Botes details her experience when she first approached local textile producers to work with Something Good Studio: “What can we do to make this the thickest, softest, best quality blanket, how many colours can we incorporate? The factories struggled to understand this mentality. They couldn’t believe we’d sell them.” Working at this scale and with these standards with regards to quality and sustainability brings with it high production costs, so these brands necessarily cater to a limited market that can afford to pay dearly. For Botes, who has a background working on the supply side of big South African retail chains in fashion, where creativity is corseted by deadlines, seasons and competitive pricing, the slower, quieter movement of the art economy holds unique appeal. “The way that we run our business is more along the lines of the way things work with art. We build relationships with manufacturers, collaborators and clients and we don’t push for seasons or trends or deadlines. We develop things in a slow manner and introduce the work when it&apos;s ready.” Something Good Studio x Lulama Wolf, Mohair Rug - &apos;Coalition&apos;, R 9,391.30 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY In some collaborations, the lines between artist, designer and artisan are blurry. Writing for Artthrob , Georgia Munnik referred to the collaboration between fashion designer Lukhanyo Mdingi and artist Jeanne Gaigher as ‘porous’. “Practising mutual permeability between the uneasy symbolic capital of a ‘fine art’ painting and the sartorial garment, Gaigher, Mdingi and the hand-crafters anticipate the body collectively,” clarifies Munnik. The collection reads neither as artwork or garment, with the role or function of clothing subsumed by the thinking, processes, materials and bodies behind it. The Johannesburg-based fashion house, VIVIERS, similarly exemplifies a fuzzying of disciplines and has been known to dress artists, curators and other insiders for art fair and exhibition openings in a way that a recent onlooker referred to as “very Game of Thrones.” In an interview with Denzel Nyathi for Bubblegum Club , Creative Director Lezanne Viviers expresses how the brand understands the relationship between creative disciplines: “VIVIERS aims to embody the idea of a New Earth culture, where nothing exists in isolation. I am, because we are, and therefore, you are… the true spirit of UBUNTU.” Viviers, MOTHERBOARD FW22, Circuit Board Slip Dress with upcycles artisanal circuit jersey and utility bag, photo credit: @Richartistry “For me she is an artist,” says Lucy MacGarry, founder of L’MAD and co-founder of Latitudes. “Her openings are experiences, she doesn’t just do a fashion show, she brings people into her space and creates this very experimental, immersive experience. She’s collaborative, and if you close yourself off to that it’s a pity, it’s not easy to keep momentum and to be sustainable.” Through all these projects, collaboration seems to be a key thread. After all, as Olivié Keck advises, “You never know where a sock might lead you.&quot; Chloë Reid is an artist, writer and curator whose research interests include everyday sociology and the relationship between reading, writing and artistic practice.</description>

      <title>Nobody Loves a Genius Child: Basquiat and the Anxiety of Autonomy</title>

      <description>Nobody Loves a Genius Child: Basquiat and the Anxiety of Autonomy - By Timothy Gawaya ---------- Figure 2: Jean-Michel Basquiat and Anina Nosei at the Anina Nosei gallery in SoHo. New York, 1982. Photo by Naoki Okamoto. When considering the great artists of the 20th century, the likes of Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, Marcel Duchamp, generally come to mind. Scholars might perhaps contend that this greatness is based on successful experimentation that furthers the medium, influence and appreciation, novel technical practices and, in the face of a dynamic global market, profitability. One need only have a glance at the white walls of the world’s leading art institutions to grasp the position an artist and their work assume; for it is in museums, galleries and auction houses, as much as studios and universities, that art history is made. The great artists are held with the highest prestige in the social and theoretical imaginary, as well as in the annals of Sotheby’s or The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Indeed, the measure of an artist’s work is heralded by their ability to command a space in museum collections and archives. There is one artist whose works have remained divisive since they were unleashed onto the international stage in the early 1980s: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Truly, if we are to define greatness along the above lines, then Basquiat exceeds the set boundaries. Basquiat is among America’s best-known artists whose fame and influence persists, as is seen by the continual references to his work in contemporary music, film and fashion. It can be widely suggested that his work is among the most imitated of the latter half of the 20th Century. His paintings exist along the intersections of race, class and art history. They at once offered a romantic view of America – the America of Dizzy Gillespie, Jack Kerouac, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis – as well as a condemnation and indictment of its sordid past. Basquiat’s enduring relevance is only matched by the record-breaking profitability of his works. His paintings, aside from drawing large audiences during exhibitions, command hefty price tags that venture well into the hundreds of millions of dollars, rivalling some of the biggest names in art history: your Picassos, Warhols, Rothkos.

Licensed by Artestar, New York However, despite all this, Basquiat’s reputation is steeped in misdirected accusations of primitivism, artlessness and childish naivete by scholars and the general public alike. The disruptive nature of Basquiat’s assault on form, convention, structure, and content has historically elicited dismissals of Basquiat as someone who composes pretty pictures as opposed to an artist in the broadest sense of the term. His work has been characterised as graffiti or street art adapted to the gallery setting, neglecting the technical skill and finesse that conditioned their execution. As one of the few black fine artists in history to gain such prominence, scholars have historically fallen victim to categorisations of his work that reek of the colonial and its apprehension of alterity. Both Picasso and Basquiat drew influence from African art; the former is a master whose sources span cultures and the latter a primitivist. This speaks to the overall interpretations, analyses and contextualisation of Basquiat’s art: descriptively, his work has been situated in the raw, the visceral, the disorganised. To wit, the ‘urban’. As the quintessential black artist, Basquiat’s works are apprehended as an expression of Afro-America, mainland Africa and the diaspora as a whole – here, from the perspective of a cultural monolith. While neglecting the auto-ethnographic quality of his work as emblematic of particular social, cultural and historical realities, the art market, scholars and perhaps even the general public, empty the rich textures evident in Basquiat’s canvases in favour of a sterile atomism and juvenile autonomy. It is much easier to sell a revolutionary vision of art to white America if white America doesn’t realise that the revolution is against them. Untitled 1982 is perhaps one of the more recognisable paintings in recent history, if not among the most expensive. It made headlines in May 2017 when it was sold at Sotheby’s for a jaw-dropping $110.5 million, setting “a new high for a work by a United States artist and is the first work of art created since 1980 that went for more than $100 million” (Kordic, 2021). At a first glance, the viewer is struck by an immediate sense of urgency that labours to make itself known. Critics and scholars have often referred to the raw, edgy, immediacy of Basquiat’s paintings, something Untitled exemplifies brilliantly. Figure 1: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Untitled 1982, 1982. Acrylic, spray paint, oil stick on canvas. Private Collection Certainly, the work is striking in its initial assault on the viewer’s visual apparatus. But to dissuade cauterised readings of Basquiat’s texts and also appreciate them as tapestries animated with very real yet peripheral histories, we must simultaneously take into account Basquiat’s biography and the provenance of the painting. Jean-Michel Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York on December 22nd 1960 to parents of Haitian and Puerto-Rican descent. His appreciation of art developed as his mother took him to local art museums as a child, with Basquiat citing Picasso’s Guernica as among his favourite works of art. In high school, Basquiat and a friend, Al Diaz, began tagging buildings in Lower Manhattan under the name SAMO (periodically stylised as SAMO©, short for ‘same old shit’). Shortly after, he dropped out of school and left home; subsequently taking on numerous jobs while also selling artworks executed on clothing and other objects as well as continuing his graffiti work at night. The ubiquity of Basquiat’s SAMO work resulted in a degree of fame and notoriety. SAMO was as much a literary experiment as it was an irony-filled polemic against dominant artistic, epistemological, and socio-economic categorisations. As one observer notes, “[more] than simply spray painting his name, SAMO was known for writing pithy critiques of the art world and consumer culture” (Bass, 2015). Following the dissolution of SAMO in 1980, Basquiat participated in a handful of group exhibitions, notably The Times Square Show and art dealer Anina Nosei’s group show, Public Address. 1982 saw the young artist achieve greater levels of fame, with some scholars contending it to be his most valuable year: “[this] succession of shows in 1982 also served to jumpstart Basquiat’s market; it was the year, Galperin said, “when collectors started to acquire his work en masse.” Nosei was said to be selling his paintings at a breakneck pace” (Gotthardt, 2018). Indeed, 1982 saw the creation of Basquiat’s most expensive and coveted paintings, such as the aforementioned untitled. Thereafter, Basquiat’s career and reputation continued to grow: a friendship and collaboration with Andy Warhol, sold out shows and exhibitions across the globe, even modelling haute couture. And yet despite his meteoric success, his career was marred with racism, both inside and outside of the art world. Consider his relationship with Anina Nosei, the art-dealer who granted Basquiat his first professional work space at the basement in her gallery. Controversially, rumours spread of a nasty and disreputable yet wildly talented dreadlocked painter locked in Nosei’s basement. In an interview filmed around the time, Basquiat is quoted as saying: “I was never locked anywhere. If I was a white guy, they would just say artist in residence rather than say all that other stuff” (Chou, 2010). Similar deprecating opinions persist – the unsophisticated, candid nature of his paintings, his lack of technical training, his boorish approach to paint application that made the likes of Pollock appear sacred. Basquiat’s reception into the white-washed milieu of art history was done in such a way as one begrudgingly allows an outsider to share their space while continuously reminding them that they are lucky to even coexist in the first place. Even after Basquiat’s death in 1987 at the age of 27 his work is still used in relation to street art or graffiti – essentially relegated to the unsophisticated, as something that aspires to fine art but fails in its pursuit. Such misguided readings of Basquiat’s work not only reek of modernist transcendental elitism, but also to the impartial aestheticisation of art history traditionally conceived. As one scholar notes, “the great Eurocentric canon is mediated by a particular relationship to history, through &apos;forgetfulness&apos; and disavowal” (Coombes, 2001: 244). This undoubtedly raises questions pertaining to what constitutes art, what is worth exhibiting and keeping, and how to redress a supposed disequilibrium in power relations. However, it is not enough to merely frame Basquiat’s position in art history as unequal and exploitative, as much as it is insufficient to posit a “ready formula for analysing power structures that are neither symmetrical nor dichotomous” (Cooper, 2005: 31). Rather, the emphasis should be directed towards utilising these tensions pragmatically – and as such, it is important to note the gradual shift in scholarship towards Basquiat’s work that is suggestive of a deepening appreciation of his artistic merit and integrity. Certainly, the record breaking nature of Basquiat’s untitled , among others, is representative of a more integrated reading. However, my greatest concern is that this appreciation is inextricably linked to the monetary value, rather than artistic merit, of his paintings – which, in itself, is indicative of a “a world [where] art has become a form of mass entertainment, artistic celebrity and wealth are normal, and art dealers among the most sophisticated economic operators on the planet” (Jones, 2017). Consider the strange way a Sotheby’s executive referred to the successful auction: ““Now he goes into the pantheon of great, great artists,” said Oliver Barker, chairman of Sotheby’s Europe. “It’s as simple as that” (Matthew, 2017). Here the implication is clear enough to not warrant an exhaustive exposition. Such a statement speaks to the underlying hierarchies and categories that more often than not shut out contextual understanding. There is nothing of untitled’s textured meanings, symbolisms, life-story – it has been emptied of its agentive and affective quality as an autoethnographic monograph. When we apprehend it we see dollar signs before a work of art. Having been so far removed from its original historical context – being the vibrant hues and colours of early 80’s New York – the painting now sits in a private collection with its history effaced in favour of an autonomy mediated by the frenzied catatonia of a schizophrenic global economy. Basquiat: Boom for Rea l was on show at London&apos;s Barbican in 2018, Exhibition photography by Tristan Fewings/Getty Images. Courtesy dezeen Magazine And perhaps there has been no greater assault to the artistic legacy of the painting and the artist responsible than the language used by Sotheby’s in their own description: “Basquiat as an undisputed master within the vanguard of young and ambitious image-makers ” (Sotheby&apos;s, 2017). In the face of growing interest and popularity, Basquiat’s work introduces the problem of addressing the role of museum collections and archival material in legitimising the emptying of meaning and context that occurs in their spaces. Certainly, these institutions assist in the preservation of artistic tradition and histories. However, the bleeding question pertains to how this preservation occurs, inasmuch as it relates to analysis, description and interpretation. We ask: to what extent is it worth keeping something if the provenance, the history and population, is erased in favour of an autonomy. By this, I mean in considering a particular object solely as a work of art in the peculiar transcendentalism of Kant and Greenberg and not a historical text. If we are to view an artwork such as Untitled from an atomistic perspective, one that nefariously stresses the autonomy of the art object as a noumenal thing-in-itself , then we neglect the importance that biography, life-story and context have to our experience and interpretation of images and objects. In doing so, we arm ourselves to the teeth and willingly participate in a violent epistemicide. - Timothy Gawaya is a Pretoria-based researcher and writer</description>

      <description>Notes from a Curator&apos;s Journal - by Nkhensani Mkhari ------------- Jack Markovitz , Oysters in Midrand, 2023, R 26,000.00 ex. vat, CONTACT TO BUY Introductory Rites A decade ago, I stumbled into the city of Johannesburg, seeking what had been called the art scene. I moved to the city because I had this inkling that I’d be further from a traumatic childhood and closer to my dreams of being an artist. My dream came true. I’m an artist now. Albeit, I’ve heard, a reluctant one. In the early days, the overall atmosphere surrounding the Johannesburg art scene was that of a mass, in the Catholic sense. A silent gathering, religious in its disposition. Strict. Seemingly impenetrable. Galleries like cathedrals and places of worship with the Artwork as the altar. Unattainable. Indecipherable. Clouded in myth and gravitas. Perhaps, except for the wealthy few who could afford it. At every opening, everyone would be so well dressed, composed, and put together. Arm in arm, flute in hand. In the early years, the clinical nature of the space(s) and extravagant objects had a way of making me feel hyper-visible yet so very small. I noticed how exhibitions had a clever way of turning the spaces, objects, and timelines we typically disregard into subjects of scrutiny and surveillance. My naivety and ignorance were a gift in this case because I felt strongly that I could change things. Wide-eyed and with great enthusiasm, I started building. Today, I’ve worked for and with organisations in varying capacities from all the corners of the art world, both locally and around the world, including galleries, artist studios, art foundations, museums, biennials, triennials, art fairs, and academia, all while maintaining an art career. Alas, I wouldn’t advise anyone to try this. I almost died. I view my career as a research process, an inversion of the working studio, researching the mediated process(es) inherent in the depiction and knowledge of culture(s) while examining the &quot;Art world&quot; as a locus of (re)production in the collective and individual psyche. Two of my key findings are: (a) Big ideas start in the arts; and (b) the art world is an organised mass. A crucible of paradox, purity codes, and prestige. Liturgy of the Word Let&apos;s rewind to 2021, when I was selected to be part of a curatorial residency hosted by the A4 Arts Foundation called Curatorial Connective. The Curatorial Connective was developed in response to the question, ‘How do we grow the critical middle between commerce and the academy?’ I came out of the residency enlightened, with new tools of observation and a keen awareness of the art world as an ‘infrastructure’, with every part playing a non-arbitrary role. My interests rapidly shifted from making objects to the curatorial. Curation is more akin to architecture than art, as it’s a structural process. Curation can be the temporary modification of a structure or that which shapes the institutional body. The art world can be pictured as a pyramid (Figure 1). The key thing here is that artists are at the bottom of the pyramid. In this pyramid, terms such as &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;value&quot; have no obvious meaning if you think of the art world pyramid as a matrix of institutional and power relations because they are decided by labour divisions within the industry and created for a variety of reasons, including academic power and market value. The bottom line is that artists hold the art world up. At the apex of the pyramid are art collectors. In most cases, artists find themselves exchanging something permanent for something temporary; mediating this process is an unequal progressive-regressive exchange where both parties hold the subject-position. As the collectors knowingly or unknowingly become custodians of the artist&apos;s work, archiving it, which is to say, collecting art, can be seen as the practise of preservation of something without inherent value, rendering it an act of faith. A potential accumulation of history in the hope that someone someday will listen or read. Our job, as the chosen few in the middle of the pyramid, is to make this transaction as equitable and frictionless as possible. I see this not just as an act of care but as one of radical moral courage. How do we make measured judgements of value today? First, we’d need to look at the whole pyramid instead of just one element, which is the art. From my perspective, we need to critique the whole infrastructure: collectors (museums), galleries, dealers, histories—everyone and everything must be implicated. To get to this place in an atmosphere of ideological parades, purity codes, and chicanery is a tremendous task, even for myself, but it’s time we invited complexity to the table. in an attempt to pinpoint the very instant of creation as such. I believe the reluctance to disrupt consensus and attentively rigorous, sophisticated, discriminatory critique is the catch-22, the elephant in the room where there can be no art criticism without art history, and that of Johannesburg and South Africa in general is entangled with the decaying quagmire of apartheid, a labyrinth of colour lines, and the ongoing rupture that followed. In my experience living in this country, this is still a sensitive topic, an open wound. However, I strongly believe it makes fertile ground for a robust discourse around the state of the arts today; critique has to be connected and contextualised with that prior history in order to make vernacular sense, and that takes work. After all, the problem is that in the realm of contemporary art criticism, there is a strong fascination with the idea of evading judgment. However, critics who mistakenly equate mere description with judgment often deceive themselves about their true intentions to avoid passing judgment. South Africa seems to be stuck between what was and what could’ve been. Just as the old ones had to take a position to make a change, we need to take a position to evolve and grow. Art is change. Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian, photo by Sarah Cascone, courtesy Artnet Liturgy of the Mass You’ll notice in the pyramid (Figure 1) that there’s no art critic or academic. What happened to criticism is what happened to Biggie. No, but seriously, with the scourge of COVID-19 came a new way of doing things, the final nail in the proverbial coffin for the old guard. (I always thought Comedian , 2019 by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was an omen.) Everything that happened after 2019 altered the whole hierarchical structure we came to know in a surreal and voluptuous way. Independent artists took off to new heights, a la Nelson Makamo, Wonder Buhle, Banele Khoza, Talia Ramkilawan, Sthenjwa Luthuli, Phumulani Ntuli, Lunga Ntila, and countless unnamed artists - everybody is complaining about the prices but biting - project spaces, artist-run spaces and nomadic galleries like FEDE, Reservoir and Under Projects took off and continue to disrupt the ‘status-quo’, curators started asking questions surrounding the many unjustified opacities in the arts, black figuration had everyone in their feelings and pockets, we all started flying to Europe for shows without any local support, independent sections popped up at art fairs, marginalised groups and individuals - Ruangrupa, Lesley Loko, Sumayya Vally, Prof Dr Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung and Others - occupied key positions in the global art world renegotiating supplanted histories and disrupting established protocols. However beautiful all this is, we need to be wary. No reform can be implemented without facing the profound penalties of anachronism and historical naivety, which may result in regressive practices and ill-informed choices. Phumulani Ntuli, Zama Zama, 2022, R 146,930.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Art criticism needs to take the long past and the shifting present into consideration to formulate a contemporary criticism that takes position. Some of the latest examples of contemporary criticism on a global scale include Hannah Gadsby&apos;s exploration of Pablo Picasso&apos;s legacy in &quot;It&apos;s Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby&quot;. The exhibition takes a critical, contemporary, and feminist approach while simultaneously recognising the transformative impact and enduring influence of his work. Prof. Dr. Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung recently published an Essay aptly titled &quot;Every Straw is a Straw Too Much,&quot; reflecting on the psychological burden of being racialised while doing art and the consequences thereof, highlighting the tragic story of Heiko Thandeka Ncube, a young Zimbabwean-German artist and educator who took his own life. His story serves as a reminder of the failures of the art-world, society and the urgent need to address racism and provide support for those affected by it. These are just two examples, both take a critical position in a moment of collective crisis. In conclusion, art criticism is a translucent mantle, never settling but constantly floating within cultural conversations. It requires us to constantly reassess what art criticism can be, incorporate diverse perspectives, and embrace the monumental complexities of the art world. By doing so, we can ensure that art criticism remains a vital and transformative force, shaping the future of art and its discourse. We need to constantly ask, what else might art criticism be? - by Nkhensani Mkhari Criticism cannot wait for the crisis to be over to have a &quot;perspective&quot; on the events. Criticism is more properly understood, in fact, as a cultural practise that is, in some deep sense, synonymous with crisis. Critical thinking is not just the act of judging or appraising. The critical moment is, as the OED reminds us, &quot;the crisis or turning point of a disease,&quot; &quot;of the nature of, or constituting a crisis. &quot;The critical involves &quot;suspense or grave fear as to the issue; attended with uncertainty or risk,&quot; while at the same time &quot;tending to determine or decide,&quot; as in the decisive moment when a &quot;critical mass&quot; is achieved in a nuclear reactor.

      <description>Kalashnikovv Gallery presents solo show by Cameron Platter -------- Cameron Platter, Spaceship, 2023, R 280,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY “This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I&apos;m offering is the truth – nothing more.” Morpheus, The Matrix Kalashnikovv Gallery is pleased to present “Fish &amp; Chips”, Cameron Platter’s first Johannesburg solo exhibition, featuring new pencil drawings and ceramics. Platter’s work across multiple disciplines appropriates and filters, in a highly personal and idiosyncratic way, the enormous amount of information available today. Blurring the distinction between high and low, his approach to art making, typically draws from sources as disparate as art history, ecology, psychedelics, fast food, advertising, therapy, collage, and consumerism. In this show, he presents drawings of a fish, a spaceship, and a crocodile. These animalistic avatars cross-pollinate each other - the spaceship could be a fish, the fish could be a spaceship, and the crocodile stands in for both the reptilian-lizard brain anxiety and prehistoric evolutionary endurance. Cameron Platter, Paradice, 2023, R 10,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY “ A sea urchin can live for 200 years. Polystyrene up to a million years. And how they and we are locked, for better or worse, into this primitive erotic dance of life. And how everything is absolutely meaningful and meaningless at the same time. I’d rather be a sea urchin, but there’s a little polystyrene in us all ” Cameron Platter, 2020 Fish have been around for 500 million years, crocodiles 250 million years, humans 200 thousand years. Enough said. As with all his work, despite being Day-Glo pop, they also occupy a darker side that speaks to the dystopian and entropic present, where humans are animalistic avatars of mass hysteria, panic, anxiety, and depression. According to various online dream interpretation websites, spaceships are markers of “a spiritual journey into the realms of the mysterious and the unknown” and “Spaceships symbolise exploration, discovery, and intergalactic travel in dreams”. “They represent a desire for adventure and the unknown, and the need for personal growth and discovery beyond what is familiar and comfortable. Alternatively, a spaceship in a dream may indicate a desire to escape from reality, a need for a change of scenery or a new direction in life.” Platter’s pencil drawings are meticulous enlargements of quick, impulsive marker drawings and collages that are then carefully plotted, and reworked-into digitally, before being translated painstakingly into pencil on paper. Read as chaotic contemporary hieroglyphs, these drawings are predictions and maps of humanity’s dark future. Cameron Platter, Greetings, 2021, R 110,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY His ceramics are child-like renders of casino chips. Casinos have featured in his work for over two decades. They’re about altered states and consciousness - manufactured realities, hyper-stimulation and sensory overload, being stuck in an endless 24/7 feedback loop. Underwritten with a healthy dose of fear and loathing, and with a deep-seated optimistic yearning to bet the farm and be able to break free from the undertow and setplay of the random allotment of contemporary bonds of race, class, gender, age, politics, history, geography, and culture. We’re all in. You’re either with or against us. In for all or nothing, knowing we could lose everything at any time. The house always wins. And we’re not getting out alive. These works are Cameron Platter - seemingly jubilant, child-like, and noisy - but are in fact calculated and informed predictions of our cultural economies, ecologies, and a psycho-state. ------- About Cameron Platter Born in Johannesburg in 1988, Platter’s work in drawing, painting, sculpture, tapestry, ceramics, video, and the internet appropriates and filters, in a highly personal and idiosyncratic way, the enormous amount of information available today. Blurring the distinction between high and low, his postmodern and multi-disciplinary approach to art making, typically draws from sources as disparate as art history, ecology, psychedelics, fast food, advertising, therapy, collage, and consumerism. He has recently been the subject of solo exhibitions at Tang Contemporary, Hong Kong (2023); WHATIFTHEWORLD, Cape Town (2022); Galerie Hussenot, Paris (2021); 1301PE, Los Angeles (2018); and Blank Projects, Cape Town (2017). Recent group exhibitions include The Bangkok Biennale (Chaos Calm), Bangkok, Thailand (2022); Tang Contemporary, Memory, Playfulness, and Stream of Consciousness, Hong Kong (2022); MoMA, New York, Impressions from South Africa, 1965 to Now, (2011); Public Intimacy, SF MoMA, San Francisco (2013); Imaginary Fact, The South African Pavilion at the 55 th Venice Biennale (2013); and and Le Biennale de Dakar, Dakar, Senegal (2010). His work is part of the permanent collections of MoMA, New York, The Zeitz MOCAA Collection, The Bass Museum of Art, The Margulies Collection, and the Iziko South African National Gallery. He was artist in residence for 2015 at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa. He has been featured in publications such as Artforum, The Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, Vice Magazine, NKA Journal of Contemporary African Art, L’Officiel, Art Africa. He was included in Thames &amp; Hudson “100 Sculptors of Tomorrow” (2019). Platter lives and works in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and this is his first solo exhibition with Kalashnikovv Gallery.

      <title>Curators at art fairs: disruptors or validators?</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/curators-at-art-fairs-disruptors-or-validators</link>
      <description>Curators at art fairs: disruptors or validators? - By Mary Corrigall -------------- Alberta Whittle, In tidal movementations she carves out memories, 2022, featured at 1:54 curated exhibition by Caryl Ivrisse Crochemar Curators were always going to be absorbed into the art fair fray. This became inevitable from the mid-nineties to the mid-noughties when art fairs mushroomed around the world and overtook the prominence of Biennales as the primary events for the public to peruse contemporary art. Given curators have customarily operated in the institutional and non-commercial sides of the art world, their interventions or roles at art fairs are somewhat viewed as either part of the branding and hype or as mildly interesting flirtations with the art market. However, in reality, perhaps art fairs are most in need of curatorial nous given the volume of artworks that surface at these events but also the fact – particularly in a South African context where some fairs attract more visitors in a day than a public or private museum can in six months. Nevertheless, it is difficult if not impossible to marry the curatorial act with commercial imperatives, given dealers need to make sales to recoup the costs of participating and staying in business. Of course, that depends on your definition of curating or a curator – perhaps many are acting as glorified ‘selectors’ as per the language Frieze employs in framing the activities at their fairs that require outsiders to steer a section. Given the ideological crisis museums are currently facing with collections that are ‘questionable’ (in how they were acquired or are produced by white men) and the fragility of their business models, which the Covid-19 pandemic laid bare. In this context perhaps the art fair can or does provide a space for more current conversations without dealing with institutional baggage. When curators are involved in overseeing sections of art fairs they can add &apos;diversity&apos; - the content isn&apos;t purely determined by commercial forces. In the African, South African context, where our public institutions are underfunded and rarely drive compelling curatorially driven exhibitions and our private institutions tend to concentrate on survey shows featuring one artist, galleries have become the central ‘validating’ forces in our art market, rendering our art fairs as our most prominent ‘institutions’ of a sort. Some high-profile African curators – from Simon Njami, Koyo Kouoh, Tumela Mosaka, Azu Nwagubugu to Zoë Whitley – have, in lending their names to various art fairs in this country and 1-54 Contemporary African Art fairs – bestowed on them a level of art world ‘credibility’ while due to their far-ranging knowledge introduced more Pan-African conversations that don’t take place elsewhere. Besides, many spaces considered to be non-commercial such as biennales have increasingly been underpinned by commercial interests due to relying on art dealers to finance the artworks. Hence the seemingly radical attempt to reengineer the latest edition of Documenta via a collective from the global South who might presumably have no links to the European art market. Veil In Peach, Medina Dugger, for Investec Cape Town Art Fair 2019, TOMORROWS/TODAY curated by Tumelo Mosaka, courtesy Art Twenty One In the South African context, where the second and last Joburg Biennale took place in 1997 until the Stellenbosch Triennale was established in 2020, the art fair was viewed as an &apos;alternative&apos; to the biennale with regards to a large art event that would entice the public to view art outside art gallery or museum contexts. This perception (however, misplaced) perhaps paved the way for curators and a curated show to be a necessary part of art fairs in Joburg. In Njami’s text for his show, As you like it , at the first Joburg Art Fair in 2008, he attempts to draw a connecting line between the way museums and art fairs ‘validate’ objects and influence their “mysterious journey”. “What are the forces that make that same object, whether seen in the halls of a museum or exhibition for sale, take on a radically different nature on the stand of a renowned gallery owner?” he asks. The presence of a curated exhibition at an art fair, he insists disrupts the art fair system. Perhaps this why over time the curated shows at the FNB Joburg Art Fair (now called FNB Art Joburg) became smaller and more peripheral. In 2017, to mark ten years, Whitley presented Truth or Some Other Abstraction , which primarily presented historical works. However, it was probably hard for this small collection of works to compete with the cacophony of contemporary expression that demanded attention. Many would argue that the art fair setting does little to facilitate the kind of considered viewing that a properly curated stand would demand. Early editions of big name art fairs – such as The Armory in New York – were defined by more experimental work that evoked museum or biennale settings, observes Melanie Gerlis in The Art Fair Story: A Rollercoaster Ride. “ It was young, new and daring,” recalls Gerlis of an edition of The Armory in the mid-nineties. She has similar recollections of Frieze London in its early years when the organisers “were committed to commission new artist projects that seeped into the fabric of the fair and often questioned its very existence.” Gerlis doesn’t attribute this vibe to any curators – in fact, the role of curators in the development of art fairs – is glaringly absent from her book, which is telling. It is interesting to observe the different approaches these fairs currently adopt towards curators and ‘curating.’ Hassan Hajjaj - Larache Studio, &apos;Le salon&apos;, 2015, Mixed media installation, Courtesy of Larache Studio, for 1-54’s FORUM, 2021 Frieze London, has invited different high-profile individuals to have a hand in specific areas of their programming, but are careful with regards to the kind of language they use. For example, words such as “selects” and “selections” or “steered by” are used where you could imagine – particularly in the South African context the term ‘curates’ might apply. In contrast, The Armory Show, which will take place in New York in September, has foregrounded on their website and in some of their marketing the curators tinvolved in that edition – for the Platform and Focus sections and the Curatorial Leadership Summit. They are all women - Eva Respini, curator at the ICA/Boston, Candice Hopkins, curator at the Forge Project, and Adrienne Edwards, from the Whitney Museum. It appears as if the organisers are leveraging this team to align with institutional shifts – in advancing women and the female-centric view that is currently shaping curatorial conversations. There is some recognition therefore that if you leave the selection of art to artists to commercial forces, diversity is unlikely to occur. As such often black, African-born or female curators are preferred choices. Curators are often relied upon to identify artists and new dealers from young galleries or countries in the global South. The benefit is that the selections are guided by someone with specialised knowledge. Take ArcoLisboa which has regularly appointed Angolan curator Paula Nascimento, to select the African dealers for the Africa in Focus programme at that fair. In appointing her in this role, the organisers can better package the presence of African dealers at this fair. Nascimento used the opportunity to ensure that the African galleries were not part of &quot;any exotic niche, nor to give a different kind of highlight and to make this program fully integrated at the fair.&quot; Curating a group exhibition of artists from a particular region was also the task of Caryl Ivrisse Crochemar for the last edition of 1-54 New York when he was tasked with bringing together works by Carribean artists. At the recent edition of RMB Latitudes Art Fair, Nkhensani Mkhari, a new curator on the scene, curated group shows, drawing from works produced by a generation of young emerging artists. Fresh from studying curating he applied ideas raised in his course. “ My curatorial strategy in approaching the special projects for the fair was inspired by research I&apos;ve been doing into gestural syntax in material cultures from various African countries. I&apos;m interested in what the women are bringing to the table...with their work challenging conventional modes of communication.” INDEX, exhibition curated by Nkhensani Mkhari at RMB Latitudes 2023, Photo creds: Alexander Smith As curators are interested in texts and dialogue they are regularly employed to curate talks at fairs – Nascimento did so at ArcoLisboa, as has Kouoh for the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fairs. In introducing her programme she observed one year that – she takes care of the “mind business” while the dealers on the floor take care of the “money business”. Given Kouoh hails from a business and financial background – she doesn’t appear to have ever studied art history – she suggested that these two areas are “not incompatible” despite the fact she is “not interested in the art market or how it works.” Kouoh was also described as the ‘artistic director’ of 1-54. Nkhensani Mkhari at RMB Latitudes 2023, photography by Anthea Pokroy Kouoh doesn’t believe that there should be hard lines between different segments of the art ecosystem – particularly in the African context. “Many hardcore museum curators like to distance themselves from the art market. They pretend to be apart from it, yet at the same time they are also aware of the influence of the market. So my question always is: “If we are all to serve art and artists from various perspectives, why is it that we create so much exclusion?,” observed Kouoh in an interview with András Szántó for his book The Future of the Museum: 28 Dialogues (2020). The role of the curator is undoubtedly shifting. In a conversation with Szántó one of the world’s most renowned curators, the Swiss-born Hans Ulrich Obrist suggests that “Given the genealogy of violence and injustice that is now widely acknowledged… museums have to unlearn the practices and behaviours that emerged from this condition and seek to build anew along antiracist and decolonized lines… at art fairs curators are not speaking back to a systemic injustice,” he concludes. After Tumelo Mosaka, the South African-born curator who left the country in the late nineties to study and work in the US, was appointed the “lead curator” at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair in 2017 he suggested that the primary goal of curating is to engage the public, societal issues, an overlooked topic, and commission, challenge and exchange ideas with artists. In truth his impact on this event was difficult to perceive, if at all, barring the establishment of the Today’s/Tommorrow section, which identifies overlooked artists and awards one of them. He said at the time that he had a preference for commissioning art that responds to a brief of his design, yet perhaps this only manifested in low-key performance works that took place at the fair. In this way prominent African curators are aligned to fairs but have little noticeable impact on them, however, this is often due to the nature of the roles they take on, which are sometimes limited to a special project or in an advisory capacity in which there is little latitude to apply their core skills. WonderBuhle Mbambo, ‘Another Strange Dream’, 2021, acrylic and metallic paint, 2180mm x 1450mm. Courtesy of BKhz For some time curator Azu Nwagubugu was part of the selection committee for the Also Known as Africa Art Fair (AKAA) that takes place annually in Paris. He also was called upon by Latitudes to serve as a project advisory member. Curators such as Nwagubugu are ideal for these kinds of roles as he is not only viewed as independent but also has a wider knowledge about the kinds of developments happening in African art not only in Lagos but in the diaspora. Independent curator Armelle Dakouo, who has been involved in the Congo Biennale, serves as the artistic director for AKAA. This role perhaps entails dreaming up special projects. Ultimately, arts organisations that stage events should have an administrative and an artistic director, as there is often a clear separation between those that know how to manage an event successfully and those that understand art and its higher purpose. On the African continent where there is an absence of opportunities for curators, many of them have had to straddle the line between the work of “the business of the mind and the money”, as they often have to create their own platforms such as Nwagubugu – who established the LagosPhoto Festival – or Kouoh with Raw Materials in Senegal years before she was appointed the director of the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art. In this way curating on the continent has entailed institution building – not necessarily driving discussions about art or commissioning artists, which is why many African curators tend to leave the continent to pursue careers elsewhere. For those that remain here, they make the best of opportunities that come their way. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based commentator, advisor and independent researcher</description>

      <description>What do we do with misogynist male artists? Does the Brooklyn Museum’s Pablo-matic show plot a good way forward? --------------- - By Mary Corrigall Installation views, It’s Pablo-matic/ Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby. Brooklyn Museum, June 2-September 24, 2023. (Photo/ Danny Perez) The foundations of Western art history are currently undergoing a profound reevaluation, spurred by a growing recognition of the contributions made by women artists who were often marginalised or overlooked. One such artist is Hilma Af Klint, whose abstract vocabulary predates the male artists traditionally credited with advancing modernism. Inserting female artists into this narrative has been met with some resistance - recently from male critics who appear to be less than enamoured by Hannah Gadsby&apos;s cheeky show on Picasso currently showing at the Brooklyn Museum in the US. The exhibition was timed to coincide with the 50 year anniversary of the famous Spanish artist’s death and its wry title, It’s Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby , clearly staked it out as one intended to draw attention to the titular ‘problematic’ aspects of Picasso’s work – and life. It has generated more attention than the numerous other shows held in museums to commemorate Picasso&apos;s anniversary, including one curated by fashion designer Paul Smith at the Musee de Picasso in Paris, which features an installation by Mickalene Thomas, a queer artist also represented in the Brooklyn exhibition.

In the African art context, where we are still in the process of canonising male artists, we seem to be much quicker to &apos;cancel&apos; living artists - though under pressure. Observers in the global South, who have long recognised Picasso&apos;s debt to African art and advocated for an alternative narrative of modernism, may find it perplexing that only now are his well-known problematic aspects being addressed in a museum show. However, there are many renowned artists and figures in the South African art scene whose abusive behaviour or gender-bias have largely been ignored or swept under the carpet until it was impossible to do so and female curators have struggled to include them in exhibitions in a way that wouldn’t cause an uproar. A striking example is the case of Zwelethu Mthethwa, an artist found guilty of the murder of Nokuphila Kumalo, a sex worker. During and after his trial his works were included in exhibitions - Our Lady at Iziko SA National Art Museum and All in a Day’s Eye: The Politics of Innocence at the Javett ARtTCentre. In both instances there was a public uproar. Many stories about the artist&apos;s behaviour came out the woodwork after the trial. This is perhaps an extreme example. Perhaps a closer local comparison might ironically be with a female artist such as Irma Stern, whose portraits of people of colour remain problematic yet this aspect of her work has never been dealt with head-on in a prominent exhibition, though artists - such as Athi-Patra Ruga - have been invited by the Irma Stern Museum to engage with this issue. Can you have your cake and eat it - show the work while rejecting aspects of it that don&apos;t align with the current social outlook? Does the high value of an artist’s work or their status compel greater silence? Picasso did not commit murder and he has been dead for half a century. However, the recent death of Francois Gilot, famously the only woman “who said no” to Picasso and walked out on him has highlighted not only the artist’s toxic behaviour towards Gilot – he destroyed all her possessions, art and her career as an artist in France (according to Sascha Llewellyn in an article in The Guardian ) but the complicity of an establishment. Strikingly, French museums do not possess a single work by Gilot in their collections, despite her prolific career as an artist and her significant influence on Picasso&apos;s ceramic art. When Gilot published a book on Picasso, it faced calls for banning from 80 prominent intellectuals and artists, revealing the extent of the institutional complicity. However, such complicity would be unimaginable in today&apos;s climate. Guerrilla Girls (established United States, 1985). Do Women Have to Be Naked to Get into the Met. Museum?, 1989.

(Photo: Brooklyn Museum) When it was reported that South African artist Mohau Modisakeng had been abusing his female partner at an airport in Jomo Kenyatta Airport in Nairobi, Kenya in 2018, women who witnessed the event took to social media, sharing the incident and condemning Modisakeng&apos;s actions. Writer and public intellectual, M Neelika Jayawardane, who was due to speak at the opening of an exhibition, Continental Drift: Black / Blak Art from South Africa and north Australia , that included Modisakeng’s work was conflicted about what to do. The curators of that show were not aware of reports surrounding Modisakeng and told Jayawardane that “when there were allegations of unethical or violent behaviour against an artist, her institution had waited for a court of law to charge the person before making decisions about removing their work or making any public statements.” In an open letter by Jayawardane published on Al Jazeera, she disagrees with this approach, implying that this kind of inaction or silence inadvertently, supports “a culture of silencing and the myth that violent “complicated” men produce brilliant work and that if abusers were no longer accepted we would have empty spaces or mediocre work on our walls.” Are institutions more severe on black artists as opposed to white ‘masters’? Given Modisakeng did not represent women in his works – they mostly centred on images of himself – would it be easier – sometime in the future – to separate his art from his alleged behaviour? Or do images of him holding weapons hint at a darker reality given what was reported in the press – or do we wait for a tell-all book or judge to make a pronouncement? Installation views, It’s Pablo-matic/ Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby. Brooklyn Museum, June 2-September 24, 2023. (Photo/ Danny Perez) Criticism of Gadsby&apos;s exhibition has primarily come from male art critics who resist the idea of shining a light on Picasso&apos;s misogynistic tendencies Is he simply too big a character in art history to be undermined, and perhaps there is a fear that this pervasive feminist revisionist curatorial eye could reach into the crevices of every museum’s art collection – or worse, destabilise the monetary value of works by the ‘masters’ at the high end of the art market? Or is it Gadsby, their (their chosen pronoun) seemingly crude take-down of this modernist master that has ruffled feathers? In considering this debate, it is important to note – as with many of the #MeToo revelations and cases - that this revisionist approach of Picasso’s oeuvre is being driven by women. Gadsby may have been the public face of the Pablomatic but it was co-curated by Catherine Morris – head of the Center (sic) for Feminist Art at Brooklyn Museum and Lisa Small, a senior curator of contemporary art. In an interview with the Art Newspaper, they suggested that it was another woman who instigated the exhibition - Cécile Debray, President of the National Picasso-Paris Museum, who approached the two curators at the Brooklyn Museum and invited them to stage a show that reconsidered Picasso’s legacy. Gadsby came to mind, as they had made headlines for railing against this master of modernism during their hit Netfilix show Nanette, where Gadsby opined that, “Picasso’s affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter has become just another part of his oversized mythology as a tortured, insatiable artist. He once said that he wanted to burn all women when he was done with them, destroying them so that he no longer had ties to the past.” L ouise Bourgeois (French American, 1911–2010). Tapestry, trial proof, 1995. Drypoint, etching on paper, 47 3/8 × 37 in. (120.3 × 94 cm).

(Photo: Brooklyn Museum) It makes sense that Debray would approach the Brooklyn Museum – they are the only museum in the US – or perhaps elsewhere that has a centre dedicated to Feminist Art – and as they serve the largely African-American community in that part of New York there has for some time been what you might term a ‘decolonising’ agenda driving some of their programming. This is the museum where African art and artists often find an institutional foothold in the US – currently the Africa Fashion exhibition is showing here. In this way, Debray, deliberately invited a critical exhibition examining Picasso’s legacy. More than likely she did so not only because she is a woman well aware of his chequered history with women not only in his personal life but in the way he objectified them in his art, but to ironically keep Picasso relevant in such a way that aligned with the times and made him interesting to people outside the art world. This is where Gadbsy came in, and Paul Smith, the British designer, who was also invited to curate a show on Picasso’s work at the Picasso Museum, Paris. Perhaps Debray figured that the French would perhaps be less open to a feminist revisionist approach and what better way of sidestepping Picasso’s less noble aspects than a show that focussed on the more formal qualities of his art such as colour, line, texture, which Smith would bring to the fore. Installation views, It’s Pablo-matic/ Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby. Brooklyn Museum, June 2-September 24, 2023. (Photo/ Danny Perez) Smith is less qualified than Gadsby – who studied art history – to curate an art exhibition, yet his exhibition has not been so thoroughly rejected by the art critics, though Ben Luke suggests in his review in the Art Newspaper that Smith’s interventions are ‘catastrophic.’ Much of the criticism aimed at Pablo-matic could superficially (without seeing either of the shows) be applied to Smith’s exhibition, Picasso Celebration: the Collection in a New Light , which also included numerous works by female artists and displays that do not directly reference specific Picasso works. In his Art News review of the exhibition Alex Greenberger claimed to be greatly bothered by “the show’s disregard for art history, the discipline that Gadsby studied, practiced, and abandoned after becoming frustrated with its patriarchal roots.” Greenberger unwittingly touches on the irony of his critique. How is it possible for female or non-binary curators to show ‘regard’ for a history of art that has excluded womxn? A revisionist approach demands that curators eschew art history and steer a parallel path, which Gadsby, Small and Morris achieved by simply including many works by female artists – some of whom were active while Picasso making art - such as Käthe Kollwitz. Guerrilla Girls (established United States, 1985). When Racism and Sexism Are No Longer Fashionable, How Much Will Your Art Collection Be Worth?, 1989. Offset lithograph, 17 × 22 in. (43.2 × 55.9 cm). Brooklyn Museum; Gift of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand, Inc., 2017.26.24. © Guerrilla Girls. (Photo: Brooklyn Museum) Morris and Small were clear that the exhibition was not intended to ‘cancel’ Picasso, but rather to create the conditions for a different encounter with his works – of which there are 100 (albeit some critics claim not important ones) – “in a contemporary moment… this is not a scholarly exhibition. We do not provide answers, we provide a space for a conversation…,” said Small. It is not uncommon for male critics to struggle when confronted with uncomfortable conversations that challenge the status quo. Their knee-jerk reactions spoke volumes not only of a gender bias but also resistance towards appealing to the mainstream audiences with accessible art curators such as Gadsby and texts paired with the art, such as one that read “Art history taught me that historically women did not have time to think thoughts, as they were too busy napping naked alone in a forest.&quot; Gadsby&apos;s &quot;I hate Picasso, but there is Cubism&quot; approach is perhaps basic, puerile even, but no one is throwing the baby out with the bathwater for now. Their efforts to challenge Picasso&apos;s legacy and critically reconsider his art in a contemporary context while acknowledging marginalised voices and exposing the deep-seated misogyny that has shaped our society contributes to broader discussions on representation, power dynamics, and the role of institutions in the art world. Perhaps we need to let a few African comedians loose in our art spaces to kick up some sand and tread where few dare to go. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based commentator, advisor and independent researcher.</description>

      <description>RMB Latitudes art fair offered discoveries of all kinds New dealers, artists and a rambling venue, made this art fair pleasantly unpredictable - By Mary Corrigall ------------------- Goodman Gallery booth at RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2023, photography by Anthea Pokroy Discovery is a word you regularly hear with regard to the value of an art fair. Seasoned art collectors view these events as an expedient way of ‘discovering’ an emerging talent, or artist from another country. An art fair is often considered to have achieved its objective if it converts those art fair virgins, who claim to have discovered art itself or better yet the joy of acquiring it at a fair. Art dealers commonly remark on a fair being useful if it has facilitated them in &apos;discovering&apos; new clients. For those art world professionals who circle these events, they perhaps view an art fair as useful if it assists them in &apos;discovering&apos; new connections that could pave the way for collaborations or access to other circles of influence. There is little doubt that the inaugural RMB Latitudes Art Fair delivered on all these forms of &apos;discovery&apos; what with new dealers, new artists and some new audiences converging on Shepstone Gardens. Reservoir&apos;s booth at RMB Latitudes 2023 with co-founders Heinrich Groenewald and Shona van der Merwe, photography by Alexander Smith This rambling setting with interlocking gardens, from which staircases and pathways led visitors to different venues, bars or patios, literally delivered on this notion of ‘discovery.’ Visitors seemed to delight in wandering off into a secret garden to discover a fountain, while some adventurous types headed up the steep staircase to the summit, returning with news of sightings of live chickens. Some people bought tickets to the fair – with the sole purpose of wandering through the lovely gardens, only to discover that art could be equally fascinating. We might associate Joburg with grime and crime, but in truth, Shepstone Gardens proved to be the quintessential venue for a Joburg experience. What makes Joburg such a compelling destination is the fact that it is defined by contrasting pockets of influence, luxury and natural beauty that exist in parallel to urban degradation. These diverse strands have historically lived side-by-side. As such attending an art fair in a lush garden dotted with buildings inspired by ancient European cultures that is a stone’s throw from the gritty urban environment on Louis Botha Avenue that is dotted with car part shops, all-day shebeens and empty boarded up shops in Orange Grove made for a truly Joburg affair. Parachuting into this bucolic idyll via an Uber or shuttle to view art and knock back wine from Franschhoek all made sense. Almost everyone seemed to revel in attending an art fair in a setting that boasted its own character, rather than circling a sterile neon-lit convention centre hall, which has become the conventional setting for the more established art fairs in South Africa. How does this impact on sales? In a convention centre, where there is typically nowhere nice to hang out or linger or any architecture or views of any kind competing with the art – you are a captured audience. The art is the focus. Does this better facilitate sales? Perhaps. Does it make for a memorable experience? Not really. Typically, you leave an art fair exhausted by what could be described as a visual assault – and you have to flick through your phone to remind yourself what you saw and liked. It’s all a blur. RMB Latitudes 2023, glass marquee and gardens, photography by Alexander Smith At the RMB Latitudes Art Fair – this was not the case – for a variety of reasons. You felt less pressured to ‘get through’ the fair – as you were not confronted by rows of booths to conquer by foot. Each discrete venue was fairly modest in size – even the ‘centre court’ - the large marquee. In between the venues were spaces to relax or wander about, so you could take in the fair in considered bites. This also meant that your impressions of the art fair weren’t reliant on the quality of the art, which sometimes worked in favour of the organisers, particularly given that some dealers were not well-established or were selling works by unknown artists. In this vein, the fair offered many ‘discoveries’ – new talents, new dealers, some of whom have emerged since Covid 19. This includes Jillian Ross Print, Origin Art, Martin Projects, Reservoir, Usurpa and Eleven Editions. The Cape Town curator duo Reservoir, who have solidified a reputation for tightly curated shows with promising new artists - made their Joburg debut with Belle Knemeyer and Justin Brett. The booth stood out among most others – due to the quality of the work, the abstract languages defining both artists&apos; practices but also the influence and ingenuity in the manipulation of their chosen materials. These characteristics echoed in the clay works by Nindya Bucktowar at the KZNSA Gallery booth, Wessel Van Huysteen’s collaged textile works at Gallery 2 and Ange Dakouo’s In my Dreams , a large hanging yellow-toned work fashioned from cardboard, papers and other disused materials, that showed at the Goodman Gallery. Lwando Dlamini, KENYA, 2023, price on request, presented by Martin Projects, CONTACT TO BUY Expectedly, painted portraits dominated in terms of genre – particularly at booths such as Artco, Christopher Moller, Eclectica Contemporary, Deal Galeria and Martin Projects, which took a risk with a booth dedicated to impasto portraits by Lwando Dlamini. One notable feature of some of the portraits is the proliferation of &apos;featureless&apos; faces. Akilah Watts, showing at The Melrose Gallery, supplanted the body, the face of the subjects with tropical fruit prints, while Selloane Moeti opted to apply red clay to her female subjects&apos; featureless faces. Azuka Muoh uses luxury car tyres in place of faces. Osara Obaseki, the Nigerian artist also obscures the faces of her female subjects in her bronze busts but also in some of her paintings, where she does so with the use of flowers. Selloane Moeti, &quot;Uthe ubaba asimulinde la&quot;, R 42,652.17 ex. VAT, presented by KZNSA gallery, CONTACT TO BUY “By depicting faces as flora, I hope to emphasize the astonishing diversity of human existence as well as our inherent kinship with other living species, particularly plants. This illustrates the idea that like humans, plants have diverse set traits, tones and growth patterns,” suggested the artist via an email interview. She further claimed that this device also allowed viewers to more easily connect to her subjects. “My work evokes a sense of universality through the purposeful concealing of specific traits. This encourages viewers to transfer their own feelings and experiences onto the artwork, thereby producing a personal conversation between the observer and the work&apos;s evocative aspect,” she added. However, she is also driven to do this to draw attention to how identity is negotiated in society. She suggests that individualism has determined our culture and eroded societal values. Given it is the first fair of this kind and Latitudes has evolved since its inaugural fair in 2019, dealers were perhaps uncertain about what kind of artworks to present. With RMB, the primary sponsor, having previously been associated with the Turbine Art Fair, and the Latitudes Online platform largely catering to independent artists, this may have fed into the idea of this fair as being a showcase for emerging, new talent. In line with this Goodman Gallery opted to show Dakouo and Smac Gallery also presented work by an unknown artist – Baba Tjeko, who presented female portraits that echoed a paint-by-numbers mode. Smac also brought smaller works and unexpectedly, a painting by Mary Sibande – more recently known for her sculptures or installations. Isheanesu Dondo, Man with a Hawk, 2023, price on request, presented by Guns &amp; Rain, CONTACT TO BUY In short, the content of the fair was not predictable – galleries such as Guns &amp; Rain, Everard Read and Melrose didn’t present works by their most prized or well-known artists. This guaranteed a refreshing fair, though of course, inevitably editioned works by the country’s top-selling artist William Kentridge were dotted throughout the fair popping up at Jillian Ross Print and Artist Press. Goodman Gallery, which represents Kentridge, naturally also presented a few of his works along with some other acclaimed artists such as Sue Williamson. A South African art fair is not a fair without a few Kentridges turning up in some of the booths and perhaps Kentridge himself. With tickets selling out there certainly was a sense in the air that this was a must-do event, which is extraordinary given it was the inaugural one. More than likely the buzz from the two – yes two – VIP opening nights was probably driving the demand and interest and as always Jobugers love nothing more than an event that is just beyond their reach. Satisfyingly, the buzz spilled out of the fair, not only onto the appropriately titled Hope Street on which the venue is located but into the Open Studios Joburg event, which was also well attended and offered studio visits with many of the artists whose work was on at the fair. With the Kingsmead Books Festival and the Word Festival at Nirox all taking place at the same time as the RMB Latitudes Art Fair, Joburg felt like the country’s cultural hub, the city to be at in the end of May. Next year, everyone will plan accordingly and buy their tickets in advance. Corrigall is a Cape Town based commentator, advisor and independent researcher.

      <description>Latitudes continues to break the mould with their next art fair edition Latitudes set out to be responsive to the needs of artists, dealers and collectors. The new edition with RMB as a sponsor builds on this but in a more upmarket and social setting. --------------- - By Mary Corrigall Khaya Witbooi, Running hard to stay in place, 2023, Presented by Kalashnikovv Gallery Latitudes&apos; inaugural 2019 fair feels a lifetime away. Not only as it was four years ago, or due to Covid-19 making years feel like decades but also due to the latest edition appearing to be so much more mature. Staged at Nelson Mandela Square in a marquee at the centre of the Sandton shopping mecca and timed to coincide with the revamped FNB Art Joburg, the 2019 edition was viewed as a secondary event aimed at offering alternative content to the latter fair and generating space for those excluded from it in the wake of its reconceptualisation. Almost everyone attended both fairs and there was a frisson of excitement in the air that the Joburg art scene had finally grown and sprouted satellite events. In the hands of seasoned art fair organisers, Lucy MacGarry and Roberta Coci, it stood out as a fair that was breaking a mould imported from Europe in providing dealers and independent artists an opportunity to participate through smaller displays or curated stands – in contrast to the one dealer per booth model or only artists represented by galleries having an opportunity to show works. The last four years have been particularly difficult for art fair organisers with the Covid-19 pandemic preventing live ones from taking place during its height. Whereas most other fairs, locally and elsewhere, have shrunk in size and are perhaps at this point content to be welcoming people to a live event, the RMB Latitudes Art Fair (LAF), which opens next week at Shepstone Gardens, has grown into a major art event that is no longer playing second fiddle to any others but is charging ahead defining its own unique character, and place on the art calendar. In short, the pandemic seems to have propelled Latitudes to new heights. Perhaps because they were such a new, small business they were more agile than others. Certainly, in embracing the online environment they turned this unfortunate period into one that also came with new opportunities. Oratile Papi Konopi, Movement 1:Cornerstones of Uzoyithola kanjani, 2022 “During the Covid pandemic we transformed our fair model into an online business and this has given us a great advantage when it comes to understanding the needs of galleries, artists and collectors. What&apos;s more, we have built a huge community of art lovers for whom we have tailor-made this event,” observes Coci. However, their agility has remained constant, embracing a return to live events and weighing in on what characteristics of that could be further exploited. As MacGarry points out, once “life slowly returned to normal and the demand for physical engagement became undeniable we began planning our second live event and it was important to entirely reconsider the traditional fair model.” Part of this reinvention has been tied to the venue, Shepstone Gardens, an upmarket events, and wedding destination that offer multiple indoor and outdoor spaces. This will make for a more interesting and convivial setting than a marquee or a convention centre setting. People are more likely to linger on the grounds and relax. It will feel more chichi, which appeals to Joburger&apos;s taste for the art and lifestyle mix. James Delaney, Remember - Boulders Series Triptych, 2023, presented by Delaney Studio “The event is focused on connection - our aim is for collectors and galleries to be able to share real moments together, galleries to connect with independent artists, and the art industry as a whole to come together in a meaningful way. Which is why we&apos;ve chosen the beautiful venue, and curated the experience with great food, wine and music,” says Coci. Snagging RMB as the title sponsor also elevated the fair&apos;s status and contributed to its professionalism, suggests Coci. &quot;RMB is truly invested in the arts, and is passionate about supporting the African creative economy. They are far beyond a financial partner, they are truly invested in making this event a success and have been involved in the planning from day one. We are extremely fortunate to have the support of such a key institution.” All of these factors, combined with staging the fair in May, seem to have all worked at attracting more dealers and some of Joburg’s biggest – Goodman Gallery and Everard Read. Goodman Gallery participates in all the high-profile international art fairs – Art Basel, Frieze London – yet they appear to remain committed to Joburg audiences and more generally, evince a keen awareness of the impact of their clout in the art scene. “Having participated in FNB Art Joburg and the Investec Cape Town Art Fair every year for some time, we are really looking forward to joining the arts community at Latitudes this year and supporting the essential growth of our local arts ecosystem,” commented Liza Essers, owner and director of Goodman Gallery. It is not just the Joburg art dealers – Melrose Gallery, Gallery 2, The Gallery, Gallery Momo (who has had a low profile for a while since closing their Cape Town branch) Kalashnikovv, Guns &amp; Rain and newcomer spaces such as Origin Art – that are participating but many Cape Town ones such as SMAC (though they do have a Joburg branch in Parkhurst) Christopher Moller, Worldart and Eclectica Contemporary. There will also be a contingent of dealers from elsewhere on the continent and the world – Doylwham and Dapaah from the UK, Artco Gallery from Germany and Suburbia Contemporary from Spain. Dealers from neighbouring African countries that have relied on South African art fairs are naturally participating too. Mozambique will interestingly be well represented through three dealers from that country; Movart, Kulungwana and Deal. Other familiar faces from The Project Room (Namibia) and First Floor Gallery (Zimbabwe) will be in attendance as well as a Nigerian gallery unfamiliar to South African audiences – Galerie Number 8. Coincidentally, artists from West Africa will be making some inroads into Joburg’s art scene. Doyle Wham will be debuting a new major body of work by Yannis Davy Guibinga from Gabon &quot;which explores African mythology, science-fiction and cultural astronomy. The overall series is titled &quot;In the Vastness of Space and the Immensity of Time&quot;, and we are exhibiting the triptych which is inspired by the rich traditions in Gabonese folklore surrounding mermaids and water spirits, such as Mami Wata,” says Carreira-Wham, one of the galleries co-founders. Christopher Moller Gallery will be presenting works from a range of artists that include Ghanaian Professor Ablade Glover and Michael Gah, as well as Azuka Muoh, from Nigeria. “Muoh’s background is in filmmaking and graphic design. I&apos;ve always been particularly fascinated with female artists from our continent. We simply don’t promote enough of them. When I spotted her work I got so excited, particularly with her message. Her iconic signature is Mercedes Benz wheels for eyes. Her art deals with toxic masculinity in the workplace,” says Moller. Azuka Muoh, The Whistleblower ll, Courtesy Christopher Moller Gallery Ecletica Contemporary will also be presenting a strong selection of works from artists based in Nigeria - Ayogu Kingsley, Osaru Obaseki and Bob-Nosa Uwagboe. Kingsley has become somewhat of an overnight success – showing in the US, Spain and other countries – due to his remarkable hyperreal portraits, often of cultural and political leaders which he depicts in America’s main seat of power – the White House. At RMB LAF, his portrait of the late fashion icon Virgil Abloh will be presented. “I have reimagined the lives of the artist in a utopian world where racism did not exist. This is why I have placed them in a setting such as the ‘White House’ and other prominent places. I am continually exploring new ideas and new ways of playing with paints, like an alchemist. Saidiya Hartman describes it as a critical fabulation which sparks new logic through imagined lives of portraits,” says Kingsley. RMB Latitudes Venue: Shepstone Gardens As with their inaugural event, independent artists – accommodated in the INDEX section - and dealers with limited resources, are still able to participate in RMB LAF. In this way, they remain responsive to the needs of artists and collectors. “We are excited about a sustainable new model we&apos;ve created for galleries from the continent to take part, in which we manage all the logistics and staffing for them. We understand the financial and logistical burden of travelling to fairs and want to make RMB Latitudes accessible to galleries beyond our borders,” says Coci. In short, RMB Latitudes is not simply promising to be Joburg’s largest art fair, but one with a pan-African and international feel, which will hopefully continue to build over time. However, with reports such as the newly released Africa Wealth Report 2023 produced by Henley and Partners, asserting that Joburg has seen a 40% decline in its millionaire population, you do have to wonder whether this city can support three art fairs. RMB Latitudes Venue: Shepstone Gardens “Our specific approach to the Fair&apos;s art and lifestyle curation, as well as its setting within an iconic Johannesburg garden, provides a completely unique offering unlike the existing fairs in Johannesburg. The existing fairs in our city are established, well attended and important events. To complement these events we programmed our fair during the winter months where there was a lack of art-related activity. Promoting Joburg&apos;s many draw-cards is also key to our messaging. As such, we have established a partnership with Open Studios.Joburg to encourage people back into the historical CBD where a large majority of artists have their studios,” says MacGarry. It is perhaps worth noting that while the Wealth Report attests to a decline in wealthy citizens in Joburg, this city remains Africa’s biggest centre for attracting wealthy individuals – Cairo comes second with Cape Town third and Lagos 4th. Despite the bad press Joburg has had, art dealers appear to have remained confident. “Since the pandemic, we have also revived the Johannesburg space - Goodman Gallery HQ - with a relaunch of the space in 2022 following a renovation which included bringing a coffee shop into the building to encourage people to gather, to dwell and to engage with art for longer. So looking forward to this year&apos;s iteration of Latitudes and being part of the growth in this great city,” says Essers.

      <description>Opinion | Why we aren’t dismissing figuration (and you shouldn’t either) Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum, Destroyer II, 2020. Image courtesy of the artist&apos;s website --------- 2020 was a landmark year for contemporary African art. The pandemic expedited the digitisation of African art and saw many artists turning to social media to create awareness around their work, hoping to stay afloat under extremely challenging circumstances. We saw artists assume the role of creator, marketer and copywriter and the traditional gallery system was called into question. With people glued to the news and their phone screens with little else to do, it didn’t take long for the brutal murder of George Floyd by police in the US to capture international attention and to spark global outrage. This saw the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement and discourse around race and identity yet unmatched in scale; again, as a result of the globalisation that digital tools and platforms enable. Lerato Nkosi, Consecrated Tyrannies, 2022, R 32,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY In the art industry, there was a ‘sudden’ collective realisation that the histories and experiences of Black artists and artists of Color have long been ignored, neglected or actively erased from both public and private collections. Figurative works were highly sought after during this period of time; compounded by the discourse outlined above, we observed an exponential increase in demand for African portraiture, as collectors sought to fill what are often referred to as ‘gaps’ in their collections (Haynes, 2020). After a three year buying frenzy, we see the demand for Black portraiture declining. While some might argue that this is basic economics and that the demand for and supply of these pieces is simply stabilizing, it is hard to accept this when multiple parties in the local and international industry refer to African portraiture as ‘boring’ or ‘tired.’ So, we ask: what do these shifts in demand indicate about the global art industry and its relationship with contemporary African art? Moreover, what impact do key players in the continental art ecosystem have on this relationship? Sthenjwa Luthuli, Untold Stories, R 120,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Revisiting the role of technology, it makes sense that there was a significant boost in the demand for and acquisition of Black figurative pieces in 2020; there were not only more collectors looking to acquire the aforementioned, but more contemporary African artists’ works were accessible on digital platforms at this point in time. However, when the decline in demand for African figuration is reviewed in conjunction with the skyrocketing demand for Latin American artists at present, it highlights that the vast majority of Western collectors and institutions’ acquisitions are trend-driven. This indicates that many still perceive contemporary African art as a trend and that an undercurrent of exoticism, the pursuit of &apos;otherness&apos;, is a key factor in their buying practices. Zanele Muholi, Bona, Charlottesville, 2015. Image courtesy Berliner Festspiele Stepping outside of the realm of portraiture, we observe similar attitudes reflected in Western acquisitions of contemporary African photography. Acclaimed photographers like Ernest Cole, Zanele Muholi and Peter Magubane have never shied away from depicting the harsh social and political realities of South Africa, past and present. While these artists&apos; legacies should not be contended, their work has thrived in international markets, exposed to an audience very far removed from the reality in which it was created. To transport their audience to a certain time, place and experience is, of course, an artist’s job; however, far too often narratives on the African experience have been reclaimed, reworked and commercialized to the detriment of the work and the artist. We came across a fantastic article by Shantay Robinson wherein she poses a most poignant question: ‘Black people may be present in the western art historical canon now. But are the stories of these regular people being expressed through the work? When we look back, will we know their stories?’ Here, one ought to review the manner in which African galleries, institutions and auction houses market African artists to Western collectors. These key players often position themselves as agents of change; while it would be misguided to argue that they have not advanced the international market for contemporary African art, we question how responsibly they are representing Africa and her artists on a global stage. Are they really seeking to inspire discourse that shifts the narrative around Africa and its art, or are they actively appealing to existing Western ideologies about Africa in pursuit of profits or recognition? Sphephelo Mnguni, We&apos;re Not Poor, 2021, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY When in a certain setting, many gallerists will admit that ‘poverty porn’ sells; simultaneously, many Black artists are questioning why discussions about their respective oeuvres are largely centered around trauma (Shezi, 2021). While discussing this article with Nkhensani Mkhari (Latitudes Online), he underlined how far removed the realities of many gallerists and influential institutional figures in Africa are from the majority of artists on the ground. Oftentimes, despite presenting work that celebrates Blackness in its various manifestations, the narrative perpetuated by many galleries is centred around the artists’ personal trials or traumas. Many artists have expressed deep frustrations around the commodification of trauma and Micha Serraf addressed this issue quite eloquently when discussing this topic: ‘Of course we have experienced trauma, but it is not the sole lens through which we view life and that, in and of itself, is worth celebrating.’ Instead of pointing fingers at what some are doing wrong, we would prefer to highlight what others are doing right, and it would be remiss of us to omit Zeitz MOCAA from this discussion. Under the directorship of Koyo Kouoh, this museum is successfully communicating that there should not be one broad brushstroke applied to the African experience or art from the continent. From the well-researched and beautifully curated When We See Us to Gilt by Mary Evans, Zeitz is presenting a considered programme that showcases the complexities and nuances of Pan-African identities and experiences. As we work towards creating a sustainable art market in Africa, we think that it is imperative to reinforce the importance of a multi-faceted contribution to the international industry, one that is isolated from trends. Quite frankly, we think that it is a mistake to dismiss figuration or to refer to it as overdone; after all, how can a three year spotlight on Black portraiture address centuries of neglect and erasure? - Camilla van Hoogstraten and Zak Buthelezi References: Haynes, S., 2020. ‘The Archive Means We Are Counted in History.’ Zanele Muholi on Documenting Black, Queer Life in South Africa [online].

      <description>Innovative technology makes professional art tools accessible Milan-based Artshell is an art software development company that specialises in archiving and managing collections of artworks. The Covid-19 pandemic not only gave them new purpose but drove more innovation that would benefit art dealers and art fairs. - By Mary Corrigall --------------- Image Courtesy: Artshell It isn’t surprising that Bernabò Visconti di Modrone appears buoyant and energised when we meet on a screen. His company, Artshell, had once again created the online platform for the recent Miart, one of the largest Italian art fairs that take place annually in Milan and Design Week was about to kick off. Milan is the heart of the creative industry in Italy. If you have had the pleasure of strolling through the Brera district of this city, which is lined with clothing and interior shops all boasting locally made products, you would have some idea of innovation and design nous that drives this city’s economy. This might not be Silicon Valley but it is the sort of place you would expect an art tech company to be birthed. When Modrone founded Artshell in 2017 he was motivated to create the software and tools to archive and manage a collection of artworks that were beyond the reach of collectors and small art dealers. “In 2017 the problem was that the available programs were complicated. They were professional tools for archives for governments, museums and big collectors. People did not have access to any easy tool to create their inventory or to easily manage their collection.” Modrone also identified a need for galleries, which are small businesses largely, to have access to tools to archive, track and promote their inventory, whether through sharing PDFs or online catalogues or generating newsletters. Artshell was developed to meet all these various demands. “We wanted to create a professional suite of tools. Creating an inventory is our core business. You can share part of your collection, which remains on the website. You can connect with customers or collectors. So, the idea was to try to help the art market with one single instrument,” says Modrone. When the company was established in 2017, some in the industry could not have predicted how vital businesses like Artshell would be to sustaining sales and interactions. Naturally, when the Covid-19 pandemic took hold and art fairs and exhibitions and the trading and marketing of art migrated to online platforms, Artshell’s business evolved and grew. Image Courtesy: Artshell “Before the pandemic, the art market was completely different (to the one it is now) because galleries, collectors, perhaps only used 5% of the technology (that exists). Using technology wasn’t seen as being so important but after the pandemic that changed.” With physical events unable to take place, digital platforms became the focus. “Finally, the market understood that technology was not an enemy and it had the power to sell art online.” Fortunately, Artshell was in the ideal position to exploit this openness to engaging with art online, but it had to quickly adapt to offer art fairs various new tools to engage with audiences. South Africans might not be aware of their familiarity with Artshell, which generated an online interface for the Investec Cape Town Art Fair for its first online edition which took place during the pandemic. Artshell has continued with this relationship and will facilitate online engagement with virtual and in-person visitors to RMB Latitudes Art Fair. This has remained an area of development, particularly since live art fairs have resumed and the online corollary to these events has had to assert its function to dealers and visitors. “This period is really interesting because actually, no one has understood how art can be promoted or sold using a website. We are looking at the best way to adapt technology to this market. If you need to buy something really useful, there is Amazon where you can easily find everything. There are other conventions to manage the fashion market online. The art market doesn&apos;t have the right model yet. Everyone is trying to explore and find it,” says Modrone. The role technology will play not only in the archiving and promotion of art but production too is still evolving, says Modrone. The rise and then fall of the NFT market and intense interest in the metaverse, which has now been overtaken by heightened awareness of AI could be evidence of this shifting space. Image Courtesy: Artshell Concerning developments in AI, Artshell have yet to harness machine learning in its products. Modrone suggests that the difficulty in applying it in the field of art relates to the fact that art objects are all unique and would require quite a rigorous classification scheme to identify similarities beyond the medium, size, or identity, or nationality of an artist. However, he seems confident that in time it will be possible to employ AI in a way that will enhance buying art. Modrone hails from an art background, having previously managed a bronze casting studio in his native Milan. However, he considers Artshell a ‘tech company’, but admits that his first-hand knowledge of the art market has been essential to its growth and success. “We have a really strong tech team. We are, of course, a small company compared to other big companies that work in the tech space. But, we know the art market so we know all the rules. We also know that businesses and people in this field are interested in the look and feel, the aesthetic aspects of online interactions. We also have an idea of what galleries and collectors need.”</description>

      <description>Collecting Art: A guide to finding the next big artist Are you looking to discover new, exciting artists? Many collectors and art enthusiasts seek the advice of experts when it comes to finding emerging artists with great potential, but the key to this is often about redefining what ‘potential’ means. - By Mary Corrigall -------------- OpenStudios.Joburg. Photo by: Sara Hallatt, courtesy of META foundation Which artists are you watching at the moment? It’s hard to escape this question when people find out that you analyse the art market, assist collectors, and have worked as an art critic. Everyone is looking for an insider’s tip. They want the name or names of artists that no one has heard of yet and whose work has barely seen the inside of a white cube but is likely to be destined for an international career. So, for all the attention artists represented by top-tier or internationally-based galleries may appear to attract, often the buzz in the art world centres on those inchoate talents that are unfurling on the sidelines. The veritable ‘emerging’ artist has a curious gravitational pull on even the most disinterested art collector, for there are few people who don’t harbour a fantasy of buying an artwork that will one day furnish them with a deposit for a luxury car, even if they have a capacious garage lined with expensive cars. As such, tracking down emerging artists with great future potential (in financial terms) is the holy grail of collecting art at any level. As I have written elsewhere and concretised in the SA Art Market: Patterns &amp; Pricing , emerging artists are not an homogenous category. They can be separated into at least five distinct, though not mutually exclusive categories: the recently graduated, the young established (under 35 years and numerous group or a few solo exhibitions under their belts), the mid-career (over 35 – who often work in other jobs while making art), late-career (over 60), and self-taught. In my analysis of patterns of pricing pertaining to artists in these groups, I found that the prices for established young artists opposed to, say, some mid-career artists could often hit a higher price threshold – in the primary market that is – often this value does not translate into the auction market. The logic underpinning this is that a young established artist is producing work that shows potential, is not as rough around the edges as that being produced by recent graduates, and they have a career ahead of them that could potentially prove meteoric. Realistically, this is only the case for a lucky few who happen to stumble on a form of expression that the market is receptive to. Themba Sibeko, The Blue Life II, R 20,500.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY The largest category of artists – not only in SA but in other studies of artists – are mid-career ones. These artists might be less likely to become famous overnight, but many have. Think of Billie Zangewa – she had been toiling away on her fabric collages almost until her early forties before her work found real traction (in Europe). The quality of work a mid-career artist produces tends to be higher, as they have been refining their techniques and vocabulary, and evolving their interests. Of course, there are those whose art has not evolved at all – they have been circling the same themes rendered in a vocabulary that hasn’t found a groove – or conversely, as with some mid-career artists, they flit from one medium to another, never really finding an aesthetic or subject matter that resonates. Ultimately, an exciting art collection consists of works that are related to each other – that share narrative links, whether around the medium, process, or subject matter, and not one that is guided by speculation or financial gain. There are far too many higgledy-piggledy collections out there with mediocre works by either ‘big-name’ artists or emerging artists who were tipped to make it big. These kinds of artworks are hard to sell on - for obvious reasons. As such collecting with purpose from early on is vital. As an African American collector recently put it, “I collect narratives, not art”. That is a sound guiding principle. In practice, of course, it means having an intimate grasp of an artist’s story about themselves, their work. OpenStudios.Joburg. Photo by: Sara Hallatt, courtesy of META foundation The best way to pursue this approach to collecting art involves attending gallery walkabouts – which are so poorly attended – and making numerous studio visits and engaging directly with artists. This direct approach is far better than your understanding of their work being mediated via an art dealer or an artist statement written by a Michaelis graduate au fait with all the latest fashionable terms being bandied about in academia. Open studio events are ideal for perusing art and chatting with artists without too much pressure. The OpenStudios.Joburg event created and marketed by Sara Hallatt of META foundation that will take place at the end of May to coincide with the RMB Latitudes Art Fair presents an ideal opportunity to engage with emerging artists in Joburg. This year’s May event will include 9 artist studio buildings that include: Bag Factory Artists’ Studios, Lilian Road Studios, Play Braamfontein, Transwerke, Asisebenze, August House, Ellis House, Living Artists Emporium and Victoria Yards. In truth, you will find that many of the artists with studios in these buildings are often making quite similar art – working close to each other appears to engender this. Many artists working from these buildings are self-taught and the quality can be uneven, so you do need to wear a pair of comfy trainers to get through all the studios until you find the artists and works that catch your eye or the story that resonates with your life experience. Foluso Oguntoye, (What money can&apos;t buy), 2020, price on request, CONTACT TO BUY As always, it is more pleasurable (and less tedious) to peruse art by emerging artists that have already gone through a (quality) filter of sorts and is ‘curated’ or are made in response to a curatorial prompt. The Rupert Museum in Stellenbosch, which recently launched its satellite museum the Jan Rupert Centre in Graaf Reinet, presented an interesting curated selection of works by emerging artists, which was the result of a call out to artists to submit works responding to the ‘Art of a Space Age’ theme. This related to a 60s space-age aesthetic and formed the inspiration for works by 39 emerging artists – though at different stages of their careers. The works shown at the In Response: Art of the Space Age , were perhaps more design-driven than conceptual - due to the theme - or perhaps totally reflective of that artist’s practice. Undoubtedly, there is a trend at the bottom end of the local art market that sees works united or ‘filtered’ according to their appearance – visual character. No doubt this relates to how Instagram has shaped our consumption of imagery, but also the Covid-19 pandemic that forced everyone to buy art from PDF catalogues or other online portals. In such contexts where the artists – people in general – are at a remove – the main selling point is the quality of the flat image and the surface interest it generates. OpenStudios.Joburg. Photo by: Sara Hallatt, courtesy of META foundation The Fourth, an experimental design-art gallery, has recently opted for more PDF curated group shows (instead of physical shows) and launched their new ‘drop’ – Post Fair Blue$. This catalogue was brimming with works by emerging artists all under R10 000 in an effort to ‘democratise’ not only who gets to consume art but who gets to sell it too, they claimed. Interestingly, and perhaps in reference to the title of this new ‘drop’ the catalogue reads like an art fair or an Instagram feed in the sense that you are presented with no context about the works or artists – just a long succession of images (with size, price information). This advocates somewhat of a different approach to collecting work by emerging artists than I would embrace – where context and narrative are essential. Just as at an art fair – every manner of expression is available – from abstract to figurative works, photographic to collage, expressive, surreal, and illustrative. This underscores the notion that there is no prevailing ‘movement’ in art – despite the claims that in response to the proliferation of figuration and portraiture, more abstract work is being made. Plurality is the cornerstone of contemporary art, after all. This offers artists the freedom to express themselves in any medium or mode that suits them, but collectors are also unburdened by any prescriptive ideals. Just as there is no insider&apos;s list of which emerging artists to collect there is no prevailing must-have mode of expression. Contemporary art is not rooted in such solid ground, but in constantly shifting sands that blow with the wind. - Corrigall is a Cape Town-based researcher, advisor and commentator.</description>

      <title>Effo Munguanzo’s debut solo exhibition</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/effo-munguanzo-s-debut-solo-exhibition</link>
      <description>Kilelo Milelo – Effo Munguanzo’s debut solo exhibition is confrontational - By Barnabas Ticha Muvhuti Effo Munguanzo, Moyibi ya Soso (Chicken Thief), 2023, Mixed Media Found objects on styrofoam core, varnish, image courtesy of the artist and the AVA Gallery We have seen it carried by the internally displaced migrants fleeing intercommunal violence, especially in the north-eastern epicentres of conflict like Goma and Bukavu. We have seen it on the heads, backs and shoulders of the shirtless and bare-footed children who toil as washers and diggers in the central African nation’s dangerous mines. We have seen it in the hands of the United Nations World Food Programme aid workers distributing food and clothes among the displaced. The polypropylene woven sack is such a common fabric on the landscape of the world’s most mineral rich, yet poorest and most unstable country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereafter referred to as DRC), that its citizenry cannot function properly without it. As such, it is not surprising that the Kinshasa-born and trained artist, Effo Munguanzo, appropriates the bag, employing it as a medium for his colourful three-dimensional sculptures which help him tell the stories of his troubled country of birth. Through his practice, the artist breathes life into the used and discarded old bags which he gathers among the migrant communities in South Africa, with some of them having been brought here from as far as the DRC. Titled ‘Kilelo Milelo’ (Today we Cry), Munguanzo’s debut solo exhibition at the AVA Gallery’s mezzanine in Cape Town (19.01.23 - 02.03.23) captures and contemplates the life of the ordinary people of the DRC in the post-covid lockdown era when life worsened for most. The title is in Lingala, one of the languages spoken in the country. The phrase, which denotes suffering, is colloquial and mainly uttered by the youths. The agony of the post-lockdown phase is expressed in Masuwa (Ship passenger ), a wailing figure placed right in the centre of the exhibition, and in Eclipse which portrays an individual on the move, with luggage on the head, possibly all the belongings. It is also articulated in Lelo (We are crying) and Kanisa Pona Lobi (Think for the future), two works in postures reminiscent of David Ndlovu’s Thinking man situated at the Civic Centre in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. These works express anguish and suffering, as has been the case of society’s lowest classes in the aftermath of the pandemic. Effo Munguanzo. Masuwa (Ship Passenger), 2023. Mixed Media Found objects on styrofoam core, varnish, image courtesy of the artist and the AVA Gallery The main subject addressed in this body of work is heavy and unbearable, yet Munguanzo still manages to express it through caricatures and therefore doses of humour at times. In Jeux de Enfant (Children’s games) and Moyibi ya Soso (Chicken thief), the artist makes damning commentary of politicians who sell empty promises to the populace and steal from the public coffers. True to the scenarios often seen in the Congo, and Africa in general, the politicians are stylishly dressed. In a similar scenario, I am reminded of a politically well-connected Zimbabwean who was granted a tender for a state-sponsored solar power project and turned up parading pairs of sneakers on social media, with no single solar farm constructed. No one held him accountable of course! Even the politicians that lie and steal from the people often have followers and disciples who praise and worship them. The continent of Africa is no stranger to airport scenes of ordinary people dressed in ruling party regalia, drumming, ululating, whistling, singing, and shouting praises at leaders returning home from foreign summits, albeit mostly empty-handed. The tradition of eulogising and idolising the ‘big men’ in politics is something that started long back in the DRC, in the days of the long-gone dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, when the country was still named Zaire. Popular stylishly dressed rhumba musicians would compose songs after the politicians. Interestingly, the tradition – witnessed by the artist from a young age – has carried on to this day. Munguanzo would like to see the end of the culture, hence in Djalelo (Guitar) , he intentionally collapses the depiction of the praise singer. Effo Munguanzo, Eclipse, 2023, Mixed Media, Found objects on styrofoam core, varnish, image courtesy of the artist and the AVA Gallery The conflict in the DRC is so complicated that it implicates neighbours Uganda and Rwanda. That the two respective nations have a hand in the conflict is not a secret. In fact, both countries are known to export diamonds, a resource non-existent within their borders. How the western world buys from them without questioning the situation speaks to the shameless double standards and despicable contradictions of capitalism. Munguanzo introduces Bi Mado , the bust of a woman adorned in a beautiful headwrap which matches the blouse. She has big lips. Seemingly out of sync with the rest of the pieces in the show, the artist explains that the character is a portrayal of the well-adorned appealing females on spying assignments to the DRC on behalf of its neighbours, especially Rwanda. Such women, on a mission of siphoning information, are the silent footsoldiers in the destabilisation of Africa’s most turbulent nation. Effo Munguanzo. Mile Lelo (You are Crying), 2023. Mixed Media Found objects on styrofoam core, varnish, i mage courtesy of the artist and the AVA Gallery Some of Munguanzo’s impeccably dressed figures have both masculine and feminine features and characteristics. I put this across to the artist who tells me a rather sad story of how he never got to really connect with his absent father who served in the army. His mother passed away when he was still young and as such, she had not fully shared the reasons why the father left. For the artist, the depiction of androgynous individuals is a way of soul searching, recognising, and respecting both parents he never really got to know and striving to find meaningful answers to questions within. If you&apos;re in the habit of searching for positive stories that shatter stereotypes on the African continent, perhaps Munguanzo&apos;s exhibition is not for you. The artist has no time to ‘fabulate’ or put a spin on the narrative to mask the appalling situation in his country. Sometimes all insiders of troubled communities desire are for their stories to be heard out there. The most we can do is respect their agency, appreciate their courage, and draw valuable lessons from the shared stories. Unlike the oft-repeated media photographs of the situation in Congo, which admittedly make us feel indifferent oft-times, Munguanzo&apos;s creative output makes us stop and ponder. It is serious, conceptual and confrantational. The artist offers us an opportunity to travel to his country of birth in our imagination. Although most of the figures in the show tell sordid tales, the bag they carry and/or are made of is synonymous with migrating individuals fleeing areas of conflict yet spurred with hope for a settled and peaceful future. It is a pity that capitalism thrives on a chaotic DRC. - Barnabas Ticha Muvhuti is a Cape Town-based art researcher and writer with interests in Modern African Art and Contemporary Art</description>

      <description>Does AI art present a new frontier or does it spell the death of the artist? AI technology has infiltrated image-making, how will this influence traditional art-making and how we conceive of creativity? - By Mary Corrigall ------------------ Photo Credit: DON EMMERT/AFP/AFP via Getty Images ChatGTP has put conversations about the perceived impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) right front and centre. Journalists and content creators have so assiduously been reporting on it not only out of concern for the general population but due to the threat it might pose to them. As a result, the emergence of an online robot that could mimic human responses and write texts should have presented a huge leap for humanity but has sometimes been presented as a slip into the muddy abyss of technological singularity (when machines govern humanity). Amusingly, it was a well-publicised (read on TikTok) experiment with ChatGTP to generate a crotchet pattern, resulting in a knitted blob that didn’t look too dissimilar to my own attempts at knitting a bear in grade 3, that finally quashed this fear-mongering frenzy that Open AI, the company that has been testing ChatGTP (it is still in Beta phase), had unleashed a technology that would displace many professions. ChatpGTP might not pose a threat to pattern makers in knitting circles, but its sister programme, DALL E-2, along with a host of other platforms such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion or Dream Studio, Art Breeder – the list is so long – are perhaps having a similar impact on shall we say, image-makers – everyone from artists, designers, digital artists, to architects. These platforms all offer a relatively new form of image-making, which is generated via text prompts. In this way, you don’t need to know how to create a digital or real image from scratch or even how to manipulate an image; you simply enter some phrases describing what kind of image you want, and voila in a few seconds an image pops out, which you can edit further, or request variations of it, and you can download it. It’s mostly all free too. For now – most are in Beta phase. Igshaan Adams. Al-Muhyee (Giver of Life) (2020) | String, rope, fabric, and glass, wooden, bone and plastic beads. 246 x 270 cm For many artists, commercial designers, illustrators, and animation creators, the initial anxiety about what this technology means for the future of art, as with ChatGPT, subsides when you test it – the quality of the images is uneven. Beginners (like myself) tend to turn out a motley crew of crude, ugly, banal or plain weird images in rapid succession. Human faces are often distorted. The image references are also Western-centric – you can’t summon an African visual reference easily unless it is well-known. You can load existing images – so you could test out a mash-up of El Anatsui and Jeff Koons. The language relies on visual signatures or words that prompt specific design, art or aesthetics – and cliched notions of those visual modes. As such you are playing with a reductive crude idiom. Making AI art isn’t as simple as it appears. You do need to understand and learn what different kinds of images emerge from certain kinds or classes (shall we call it) of words, as well as the unique qualities of the different platforms and the different GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) architectures at play. GAN drives this technology and relies on deep learning methods – that is once the machine is &apos;trained&apos; it can do the work on its own. The results depend on the &apos;initial&apos; training - the input of data and the patterns it detects. As such the machine/programme learns from the data – and importantly how the data is classified – the labels attached to it, which are processed via different kinds of neural architecture. Hence, the text-driven input. GAN technology has been around since 2014 but, according to Jonas Oppenländer, a digital-tech academic, it was the release of Open AI’s CLIP (a contrastive language-vision model) in January 2021 that propelled the technology forward. Now, it seems there is no going backward, but only forward headlong into the AI stratosphere. On Midjourney’s Discord server you can view works made by more seasoned AI artists, who have mastered ‘prompting’. They tend to be fairly illustrative in their appearance, or are fantasy centred – echoing an aesthetic you associate with gaming, animation – other digital arts. There is certainly a correlation between entering a new era of scientific progress and with the popularity of cliched sci-fi imagery – much like the abundance of space travel imagery that surfaced in the NFT market. Naturally, this excess of imagery being generated is going to feed into the NFT marketplaces, where digital art currently is traded, though the ownership of the imagery remains up for debate. Presently, the main challenge this form of AI technology (there are others that are being used in the production of traditional art, such as sculpture) presents for the traditional art market is ideological; as it raises questions about the concept of art, authorship, and the nature of creativity. AI has turned the screws on notions of authorship. The visual data it draws from isn’t manufactured, it is derived from existing images – some of which belong to artists, designers, illustrators and digital artists –often without their knowledge or consent, which has naturally caused an outcry and copyright lawyers in the US have argued that unauthorised derivatives do constitute an infringement. Getty Images filed a lawsuit last month against Stability Ai – creators of Stable Diffusion. They claimed the Stability AI sourced 12 million images that belong to their database, according to an article in The Verge . A class-action lawsuit filed by a group of artists in the US against Midjourney is also in the pipeline. Artists can work with their own images and manipulate them further using a text prompt but in such instances do they cite the AI platform as co-author – as some have been doing for the sake of transparency? Should the curators of the datasets be credited or those that train the algorithm and modify the parameters? That’s a long list of people. However, most artists in the regular real art world from William Kentridge to Igshaan Adams – rely on groups of people to make their art and rarely, if ever are they credited as co-authors. This was the point raised in a recent discussion on this topic on the Art Smack podcast hosted by Jerry Gagosian, where they discussed the fact that Jeff Koons hardly lifted a paintbrush and relied on a studio full of painters and other artists to make his art, yet still claimed authorship of it. Art Smack podcast hosted by Jerry Gagosian, Courtesy of Art Smack The speed at which these AI programmes or tools generate art is alarming. Can art that is made this quickly have value and exactly what properties of it would be valued? Not surprisingly, it seems that mastering the art of AI relates to a particular kind of linguistic ability – due to the text prompting and has given rise not only to a new profession dubbed Prompting Engineer but has also led to a rise of communities – particularly on Discord – where you not only enter the Midjourney universe but find yourself in the thick of AI art generation via multiple channels where you can see what everyone else is creating and share and learn how to get better results. Everyone is making ‘art’ and is unleashing their creativity – given now, time, materials, years of training or knowledge of technology are no longer needed. This should be the art utopia we dreamt of but as Ziv Epstein, Sydney Levine, David G. Rand and Iyad Rahwan, assert in their journal article, Who Gets Credit for AI-Generated Art? , “Given the ease of use and emerging ubiquity of text-to-image generation, the question arises: If anybody can produce digital images that resemble masterful pieces of art by simply feeding textual prompts into an opaque system, is text-to-image art creative? What is the nature of the human creativity involved in generating images with text-to-image synthesis?” Perhaps the most interesting part of the AI art revolution is that questions such as the above are not being posed by art theorists but by scientists, who are trying to define or redefine what creativity is. In fact, much of the discourse being driven in this field is by a new generation of scientists and tech entrepreneurs and specialists, who are making art on these various platforms. This has allowed art and science to converge in an unprecedented way. What happens when science pushes art forward? Well, some suggest that this has been the case since the artists of the Renaissance era when scientists informed artists about linear perspective, among other things. The most seismic impact technology has had on art was the invention of photography. While the Victorian era British, artist, and critic, John Ruskin was horrified that what would take him four days to create could be faultlessly captured in a few seconds, he revelled in the impact the medium had on art, which relieved artists of the burden of capturing reality in a purely representational manner. Some art historians argue that the invention of the camera kick-started modernism. Coincidently, the smartphone camera has somewhat displaced photographic art. In an interview with Roger Ballen many years ago, he observed that the shift in his practice (from the documentary to his more ghoulish expressive work) was because everyone was taking pictures and he needed to create images that no one else would ordinarily. Roger Ballen, Ouch!, 2020, Archival Pigment Print, Courtesy of the Artist The sheer excess of AI art that will be produced might well reinforce the value of tactile objects, traditional paintings and sculptures. However, it may also push painting in new directions, as digital art has already with painters not only recreating a digital screen image with paint but allowing for a machine (or an algorithm) to be used as a tool to create different kinds of images that perhaps are beyond the artist’s imagination and translating that back into a real object. And, yes, as with the mobile phone prompting photographers and photography down another less travelled or expected path, artists are likely to be challenged to create more interesting imagery than an AI tool can conjure. Ultimately, though it seems likely that these generative AI tools are going to bolster and grow the digital art field substantially. Subcultures have already sprung from the wells of these new tools, engendering not only new aesthetics and philosophies around what constitutes art but collectors and markets for this new wave of artmaking. Will the next generation of artists need to study machine learning and create their own AI tools, where they have more control and forge their own neural architecture? - Mary Corrigall is a Cape Town-based art commentator, consultant and independent researcher</description>

      <description>An exciting crop of young artists is rewriting the exhibition rulebook - By Sean O’Toole ------------------ FEDE Arthouse, Installation view of works by Reef Sithole&apos;s and Keith Virgo, BROWSE THE SHOW Something happened in the South African art world during the enforced slowness of the recent pandemic. Frustrated by the staid and settled business rituals of life pre-2020, formalities that did more to exclude than welcome new artists and audiences, a cohort of younger artists and curators, many acting with a network of allies, decided to rethink the rules of the game. In the process, many artists have discovered their agency and right to play. Emboldened by the experience, some have even started their own galleries. If none of this makes sense, here is a brief recap of what’s been happening outside the formal gallery system. Over the last few years, responding to a freeze in travel and trade during the Covid-19 pandemic, artists came up with DIY solutions for showing and selling their work. One widely discussed shift involved the phenomenon of artists trading through digital channels like Instagram. Cape Town painter Gitte Maria Möller’s sizable army of followers and international buyers was cultivated on social media during the pandemic years. But Instagram is the least interesting expression of the new zeitgeist, particularly in South Africa, where commercial representation is bound up in time-worn protocols and biases. Channelling the spirit of painter John Koenakeefe Mohl, a founding member in 1960 of the Artists Under the Sun exhibitions, younger artists have over the past few years presented pop-up selling exhibitions in rented spaces (among them Lebo Kekana, Anna van der Ploeg and Sivan Zeffertt) or even in their own homes (Dominic Pretorius). Talia Ramkilawan, “An Ode Not to her, but to me”, 2020, Wool and cloth on hessian, R73 000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY In early 2022, making use of the abundant empty retail space left in the wake of the pandemic, Cape Town artist Brett Seiler and a group of friends staged a series of one-day exhibitions at the corner of Buitenkant and Roeland Streets. One of these, Hellmouth, curated by Seiler and Max T. Law, included the launch of a snarky ‘zine. It featured writings by artists Oskar Keogh, Thulile Gamedze and Mitchell Gilbert Messina. Cause and effect are important drivers of innovation in the art world. Messina and Seiler would later come together, with fellow artists Luca Evans and Guy Simpson, to found Under Projects. Located around the corner from Seiler’s earlier exercise with flash-mob curating, Under Projects has hosted a series of innovative exhibitions. Their turnaround is tight: shows are only up for a week. The venue’s rough and ready approach to showing recalls the punk spirit of Wayne Barker’s roaming Famous International Gallery of the early 1990s. Anna van der Ploeg, Five hours refusing to eat, Oil on cotton, 93 × 60 cm, 2020, courtesy of the artist Under Projects bills itself as an artist-run project space. For other artists, like Michael Tymbios of Gallery-De-Move-On and Lebo Kekana of FEDE, also Heinrich Groenewald and Shona van der Merwe of Reservoir, friends since their art studies at Stellenbosch University, roaming is preferable to the formality of brass nameplate at a fixed address. Their decision to operate as nomadic enterprises bears pause. “The first and primary itinerant is the artisan,” write Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in Nomadology: The War Machine (1986), a cult book about martial strategies and nomadic practices. “The nomad,” they state, “has a territory, he follows customary paths, he goes from one point to another, he is not ignorant of points (water points, dwelling points, assembly points, etc).” Fede Arthouse, works by Nkhensani Mkhari, CONTACT TO BUY The recent Cape Town Art Fair provided an assembly point for South Africa’s artist-run and nomadic galleries. Under Projects, Gallery-De-Move-On and Reservoir all had booths at the fair. Gallery-De-Move-On’s decision to pay and play owed a great deal to the lack of traffic at their pop-up show at an address nearby the fair in 2022. Under Projects used their space to present a display of completed projects. Reservoir, which has previously collaborated with Whatiftheworld and THK galleries on selling group shows, cemented its status as an alt-dealership to watch with fine works by Bella Knemeyer, Dale Lawrence and Anna van der Ploeg. Identifying and naming the emergent phenomenon of placeless art platforms and galleries without walls, while important, tends to minimize the very real frustrations that led to their emergence. Writing on Instagram in December 2020, artist Lebo Kekana, founder of FEDE and collaborator with Jeanne Gaigher on a work at the recent Cape Town Art Fair, stated: “Art is the birthplace of innovation and creativity. It’s with this sentiment that a need arose to provide consumers and overall art enthusiasts with the opportunity to consume art in a space that deviates from the traditional template of four white walls.” Brett Seiler’s ‘Reading list, 2019’ rendered using pine, canvas, Belgian linen, roof paint and bitumen, courtesy Everard Read Kekana, who is in his early twenties and makes figurative paintings depicting love and estrangement set along the Cape’s shoreline, started FEDE because of an age-old frustration. “I really wanted to get into the art scene in Cape Town, but I wasn’t very familiar with the channels or which doors to knock on,” he said in an interview last year. Rather than nurture resentment at the art world’s strange codes and habits, FEDE set out to show artists they liked in a way they liked. Their recent curated exhibition, Process, included work by Andile Dyalvane, Tony Gum and Nkhensani Mkhari, as well as an artists’ luncheon. Hospitality is a sentiment shared by artist Daniel Bruce Gray and scholar Amie Soudien. In October 2021, Gray and Soudien launched 1004 in their Johannesburg apartment with a solo exhibition by Kaelo Molefe. “In figuring out how to realise the apartment as a project space, we were excited about the untapped flexibility of the domestic space that is, for those hours, transformed by the people inhabiting it. We wanted to create an approximate feeling of familiarity and warmth with 1004, particularly in an art world that rarely feels hospitable.” Kaelo Molefe,The Dandy, 2021, paper collage on fabriano Soudien wrote these words for wherewithall , a roving live and digital platform birthed during the pandemic. Co-founded and run by artists Kundai Moyo and Chloë Reid and curator Amy Watson, it provides a network for ideas and tools to realise exhibitions. Reid’s frustrations with making independent exhibitions in Johannesburg after settling there in 2019 was one catalyst for the project. In a truer telling of the rise of DIY exhibiting and dealing, the pandemic was less the cause than a catalyst of change. It has always been tough forging a path as an independent artist and curator in South Africa. Being a nomad is a tactic of survival. Hustle, wherever and however, is central to being seen and heard, to growing new audiences, ultimately, to claiming one’s right to determine art’s future.</description>

      <description>When the Ordinary becomes Extraordinary Red carpet events, flashy outfits and celebrity status surrounded the opening of Zeitz MOCAA When We See Us. Beneath the fanfare was an exhibition centred on the simple joys of life. - By Mary Corrigall --------------------- Amoako Boafo, Teju, 2019, Oil on canvas and mixed media, 170.2 x 154.9cm, Ⓒ 2022 Amoako Boafo / licensed by Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York and DACS, London, Theme: Repose There hasn’t been so much hoopla surrounding an opening of an exhibition than When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art (MOCAA) in Cape Town. With Gucci as a sponsor and a fundraising gala dinner and party attached to the opening a red carpet was rolled out and the usual suspects on the social scene popped up on it, alongside a few international stars such as British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw – who was there to co-chair the gala and add a bit of Hollywood gloss. For this reason much of the communication in the run-up to the opening centred on who would be attending the gala rather than the art celebrities whose works were on the exhibition such as Amoako Boafo, Kehinde Wiley and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye among others. Cassiee Namoda, To Live Long Is To See Much (Ritual Brothers III), 2020, Oil on canvas, 152.4 x 233.6cm, Courtesy of Jorge M. Pérez Collection, Miami © Courtesy the artist and Goodman Gallery, Theme: Spirituality As a result, the art and artists seemed of less importance to the events than the so-called celebrities and the exhibition appeared to be more of an expedient marketing tool that would align with Gucci and a new audience – young black professionals. In reality, this was no easy feat; there is a lot of admin involved in sourcing works and convincing 74 art collectors to lend works for this show. Inarguably, When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration , is a sexy show – the list of artists included is staggering in number – 156 – and it includes a high number of works by well-known African American artists that are hot in the US – Jacob Lawrence, Mickalene Thomas and Tschabalala Self among many others. Indeed, the stats on the exhibition that Zeitz MOCAA provides state that the majority of works are by American artists – and probably numerous other African-born artists that are based in that country. Zandile Tshabalala, Two Reclining Women, 2020, Acrylic on canvas, 122 x 91.5cm, Courtesy of Zandile Tshabalala Studio, Theme: Repose You could call it a blockbuster show of sorts, though even due to its populist appeal it might not see queues lining up outside Zeitz MOCAA to see it. This may be due to the emphasis on who was attending the gala than educating South Africans about these American artists or perhaps it takes more than one splashy aspirational event to build foot traffic. If you looked beyond the title of the show and at the works and, of course, the participating artists, this exhibition at its core was centred on Portraiture, the black portraiture trend that swept across the continent during Covid-19. Curator, Kouoh Koyoh, also the executive director and chief curator at Zeitz MOCAA, perhaps wanted to avoid using this term as there have been some negative associations with it – such as lacking conceptual hoof (read vacuous) and more importantly, being market-driven. It has always been presumed that the roots of this movement shall we call it resides in the US and this exhibition proves this to be the case. However, in sidestepping the ‘portraiture’ term this point couldn’t be obviously claimed curatorially in the display. Jacob Lawrence, Genesis Creation Sermon V: And God Created All the Fowls of the Air and Fishes of the Seas, 1989, Gouache on paper, 75.5 x 55.8cm, Ⓒ The Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation, Seattle / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York and DACS, London, Theme: Spirituality It is to the benefit of South Africans to have access to works by such an acclaimed group of African American artists but also those that you might not have been aware of - such as Devan Shimoyama, whose work titled The Abduction of Ganymede (2019) is a highlight of the exhibition. With its glittered black subject in his rainbow-coloured body (alluding to the gay pride movement) riding on the back of an eagle this image embodies the spirit of this exhibition; joy, revelry and freedom. This image refers clearly to homosexuality and claiming that identity, which has been difficult in many black communities. Oddly, the work is located in a section of the exhibition under the ‘spirituality’ label – might its reference to Greek mythology serve as that link? In an exhibition of this size, you need to group works under sub-themes to keep audiences engaged by feeding them some binding narrative through which to frame their journey. There are six themes, shaping this exhibition – The Everyday, Joy and Revelry, Repose, Sensuality, Spirituality, and Triumph and Emancipation. Expectedly, this does flatten the meaning of a lot of works, though at times Kouoh uses them to disrupt our perceptions of the theme title. For example, an impressive portrait of a man ruminating on a green valley by Toyin Ojih Odutola titled Surveying the Family Seat (2017) punctuates a collection of works under the ‘joy and revelry’ theme which mostly consists of paintings of crowds of people at parties, bars, and concerts. In this way, Odutola’s painting is a more political statement on the topic speaking to ancestry, belonging, or even land ownership. Cheri Cherin, Revolution Obama, 2009, Acrylic and oil on canvas, 200 x 300cm, Theme: Triumph and Emancipation Does an artwork always have to have a deep meaning or make a political statement? With the emphasis on presenting the titular everyday scenes from works presenting people gathering at a marketplace, lying on a sofa reading a book, or two men playing chess or a couple lying in bed, there is a sense that in this exhibition Kouoh is arguing for the value of art depicting the ordinary, though often in extraordinary ways. It is the delivery that elevates the ordinary. Boafo’s Teju (2019) is by no means an ordinary work despite it depicting ordinariness – a woman sitting on a sofa. Depicting black subjectivity doesn’t always have to be underpinned by political or social intent – perhaps in its apolitical-ness it is political. By averting the burden of dealing with the white gaze, colonial history or racism this form of portraiture or figuration presents a reality beyond these weighty conditions or a pervasive supremacism or even overturning of it that infiltrates expression or our reading of it. Hence the title of the exhibition; When We See Us . See &apos;us&apos; rather than what you think surrounds &apos;us&apos; - is one reading of this title. Many of the works express an exuberance, an excess even in terms of colour, texture and, of course, pattern (as is the case with African art) and these characteristics are channelled through different modes of expression from a flat pop aesthetic, surreal expressiveness to hyperrealism – this exhibition is worth a visit simply to view the extraordinary triptych by Meleko Mokgosi titled Pax Kaffraria: Graase-Mans (2014). Gerard Sekoto, Portrait of a Woman, 1970, Gouache on paper, 52 x 35cm, Ⓒ Gerard Sekoto Foundation / DALRO, South Africa / DACS, London 2022, Photo by Dillon Marsh, Theme: Triumph and Emancipation Kouoh is perhaps revelling and celebrating in the abundance of African art that is enjoying so much visibility globally (particularly in the US), while carving out a curatorial space where there are no conditions upon which blackness must conform to or perform. This can only be done in Africa perhaps. As such &apos;non-performance&apos;, a celebration of the ordinary takes centre stage. Not that there are no overtly socio-political works in this exhibition. South Africans will particularly enjoy Katlego Tlabela’s Tableau Vivant III (2020) which presents a white butler waiting on a black man enjoying a swim in a giant swimming pool. Many young, lesser-known South African artists such as Tlabela are included in this exhibition. It is refreshing not to be confronted with the same artists over and over but at the same time it is disappointing that while the most celebrated West African, Nigerian, and American artists are included there are so few living (excluding Sekoto,Pemba) high-profile mid-career South African artists with works on the exhibition - apart from Cinga Samson. The final section of the exhibition concludes with the theme ‘Freedom and Emancipation’ and does touch on liberation and its impact on subjectivity in the political sphere - particularly in an image depicting former president Barack Obama taking office in the US by Chéri Chérin. As this work suggests, and in line with the rest of the exhibition, the emphasis is not on a violent and traumatic battle but rather a light celebration that suggests a dawn of new era. Cheri Samba, Homage aux anciens créteurs, 2000, (Signed and dated), Acrylic on canvas, 135 x 200cm, Courtesy of MAGNIN-A Gallery, Paris, Theme: Triumph and Emancipation Chérin&apos;s painting highlights this link between events in the US concerning African Americans and those on the continent. America&apos;s cultural dominance has assured a connection as has a history of slavery and racism. What does it mean for an exhibition on black subjectivity to be dominated by African American artists on the African continent? Does it further advance cultural dominance, paper over cultural differences or forge existing links? In keeping the focus on the ordinary moments of ‘joy’ – a sentiment Marie Kondo would approve of – Kouoh perhaps nullifies the need to question or explore cultural differences not only between Africa and the US but surrounding all the different nationalities of the artists represented on the show. African curators have been wanting to get beyond geography-bound curating for some time. Besides, after a sustained succession of solo survey shows at Zeitz MOCAA and the Norval foundation, a group show of any kind is a welcome reprieve in Cape Town. - Corrigall is a Cape Town based art commentator, consultant and researcher</description>

      <description>The lasting changes of the Investec Cape Town Art Fair - Words by Chaze Matakala ------------------ The 10 th edition of the Investec Cape Town Art Fair will be taking place this weekend at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Celebrating a decade of magnetising galleries from all corners of the continent and beyond in the past, this iteration will explore the notion of time . Chaze Matakala is curious to hear from the different regions on the artists of the moment and the future of contemporary African art. April Kamunde, Tafakari ya Mama Max I; Now What, 2022, Oil on Canvas. Image Courtesy of Afriart Gallery As a time traveller through the written word, Octavia Butler declared that “the only lasting truth is change” in her seminal 1993 novel, The Parable Sower . Whether you believe we are living in a post-apocalyptic world or not, the role of the arts and the gatherings that uphold its propagation are inextricably linked to growth and change. Galerie Cecile Fakhoury opened it’s first space in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, around the same time that the first edition of the Investec Cape Town Art Fair (ICTAF) took place. For the eponymous founder of the gallery, the motivating force was to establish an ecosystem for the African and diaspora art community, aimed at artists and collectors in particular. A common influence that Galerie Cecile Fakhoury and ICTAF have added weight to is the tipping the scales to the overall tendency that African artists need to leave the continent in order to be visible. The tandem growth over the past decade has witnessed the number of galleries in West Africa multiplying and the number of exhibitors at ICTAF shifting from feather to heavyweight.

The progress for Galerie Cecile Fakhoury is palpable, with the younger sibling space in Dakar, Senegal coming onto the West African art scene in 2018. Delphine Lopez is the director of the Dakar gallery and she affirms that there has been fluid movement in West Africa. “There is more and more structure, still very few institutions, the market is growing little by little, and a new generation of collectors are starting to look at local artists” says Lopez. In terms of conceptual and theoretical development, the scene in Dakar has been blooming in Lopez’s opinion, and ICTAF provides a bridge between the Francophone and Anglophone African art scenes. “For us as a French-speaking-based gallery, it is very important to be a part of ICTAF and ArtxLagos for example, because it’s creating bridges between the two scenes and we are opening to collectors, projects and artists from the Anglo countries and vice versa” says Lopez. Looking broadly at the profile of art collectors, African Francophone collectors apparently share a familiar context, a common colonial history and as a consequence- language. Interestingly for Lopez, collectors in the West African Francophone region are of an older generation and have a set niche one what they collect and why. On the other hand, “I think collectors on the continent and mainly from the English speaking countries are quite younger, maybe more experimental in the way they are building their collections” Lopez shares. Galerie Cecile Fakhoury will be exhibiting work by Parisian-based artist Elladj Lincy Deloumeaux, who excavates from his Guadeloupian heritage to explore and document Afro-Caribbean spirituality and rites of passage on the journey of self-knowledge. Over time, the ICTAF has provided a space for collectors to pull together artworks from their region and to gradually expand to other parts of the continent, effectively reinventing the ways in which art business is done on the continent. A geographical neighbour with contentious and deep connections to South Africa is Zimbabwe, of which First Floor Gallery Harare has been participating in ICTAF since the Fair’s inception. Established in 2009, First Floor Gallery Harare was emerging in a transitional time of hyperinflation and profound isolation in Zimbabwe, led by Valerie Kabov and Marcus Gora. Their focus was on extremely underserviced young artists in the country which boasts and small yet extraordinary rich art scene. The isolation of sanctions and scarce internet connectivity birthed unique Zimbabwean artistic voices which have emerged from pressures of society rather than pressures of the art market. Director of First Floor Gallery Harare and art historian Valerie Kabov believes that the success of Zimbabwean artists, such as winner of the ICTAF 2019 Tomorrows/Today prize Troy Makaza, and a plethora of other highly sought after Zimbabwean contemporary artists in the international arena, has to translate to back home. “We have extremely vibrant talents who have benefited from the interest in contemporary African art” says Kabov, “we don’t have anything that we can call a local art market, it’s only just emerging and we have an under-serviced art school sector.” Elladj Lincy Deloumeaux, Aroure du Matin, 2023, Acrylic and Oil on Paper. Image courtesy of Galerie Cécile Fakhoury First Floor Gallery Harare discernibly represents artists who are on the pulse of relevant and vivacious artistic praxes, such as this year’s Shamilla Aasha in the ICTAF Tomorrows/Today section co-curated by Natasha Becker and Dr Mariella Franzoni. Asha’s will be showcasing a textile-based body of work titled Seamless which curators Becker and Franzoni describe as conveying “a visual tension between delicacy and potency, spirituality and materiality.” Kabov is proud of the fact that the older generation artists are building up their own infrastructure including studios and residencies. She elaborates that “overwhelmingly our artists stay at home, considering that we don’t have a local market you would imagine that people would want to leave the country but Zimbabwean artists stay, which is amazing.” What can be described as the circular artistic economical mind set of contemporary artists in Zimbabwe is mirrored in the East African art scene. This is where artists such as Nairobi-born painter April Kamunde have witnessed the Kenyan art community support itself through self-made platforms and mentorship by senior artists to emerging artists. The past 10 years for Kamunde have been a shared period of slow and steady growth for self-taught visual artists. “As opposed to depending on the established avenues to showcase work, they are getting more creative in terms of being more entrepreneurial and chasing ‘the bag’ through cross-collaborations with small business entities and local brands” explains Kamunde. This upsurge in ingenuity underscores the growing hunger and inimitable ability of creatives to feed themselves. The 10 th edition of the Investec Cape Town Art Fair will be taking place this weekend at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Celebrating a decade of magnetising galleries from all corners of the continent and beyond in the past, this iteration will explore the notion of time. Image courtesy of Stephanie Veldman Kamunde will be exhibiting outside of East Africa for the first time this year at ICTAF with Afri Art Gallery which is based in Kampala, Uganda. Kamunde’s practice encompasses oil paintings, exploring shared and personal intimate stories and responses to feelings of weariness. In her body of work Pursuit of Peace , Kamunde unearths themes of rest and comments on notions of femininity, going beyond the surface level of self-care. Through a poignant reclamation of personal space and time, Kamunde depicts the recurring motif of the Dera (a long Somali dress) as an icon of the African woman’s true state of relaxation. On the topic of tiredness compounding over time, Kamunde declares that she wants to “validate and investigate this feeing, to document more realistic depictions of peace… Going out to sun bask, to sit under a tree and just chill.” As Kamunde invites audiences to look at moments of accessible slices of peace, attendees at ICTAF may explore intimacy through the tapestries of Aasha’s conception of falling in and out of love. Perhaps the enduring and ethereal oil and and acrylic paintings of Deloumeaux may offer viewers contemplations on the journey between diasporic and African worlds which need no verbal language to comprehend. The 10 th revolution of ICTAF around the sun has much to to offer in terms of vividly bringing to life the ever-changing landscape of contemporary African art, promising equanimity in vast forms.</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/a-swivel-7-asides-on-abstraction</link>
      <description>Everywhere, it seems, abstraction is the resurgent signifier. How so? Because we are tired of being told what to see and value? Because ours is a world riven by identity politics, split by extremism on the Left and Right, consumed by the spectre of fascism – by Absolutes.</description>

      <description>Is it possible to hold an exhibition with only three paintings? More importantly, can you drum up an audience without disappointing them? Surprisingly, a Joburg-based curator, Clive Kellner, director of the Johannesburg Contemporary Art Foundation (JCAF), has managed to achieve both with the latest exhibition, Kahlo, Sher-Gil, Stern: Modernist Identities in the Global South.</description>

      <title>FEATURE: On K Sello Duiker, Damien Hirst, and Mountain Retreats</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/feature-on-k-sello-duiker-damien-hirst-and-mountain-retreats-1</link>
      <description>FEATURE: On K Sello Duiker, Damien Hirst, and Mountain Retreats A feature by Ashraf Jamal for ArtThrob My dog and I are in ‘K Sello’ (Duiker), my daughter next door in ‘Herman’ (Charles Bosman). We’re at McBains in Bainskloof, a mountain retreat co-owned by Justin Nurse and Ma’ayan Hamiltion. He — K Sello — is a long-lost, long-dead friend and author of the most significant South African novel of the last 30 years, The Quiet Violence of Dreams. Pre-woke, Duiker’s novel has an honesty few comprehend today. He saw the rise of ‘neo-black’ fascism and wrote the dirt on our pathological inheritance in a prose that is alive to a human perversity which most these days suppress, or worse, ‘cancel’. Revisionism is the new norm; the art world aglow with nuclear green sanctimony. Not something that Duiker would have approved of, well, not the desperate-contrite-faux sheen of care which generally accompanies the heist at least. Then again, revisionism has greater merit than Damien Hirst’s toxic ‘Empathy Suite’ in the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. At $100,000 a night, it is the most expensive on earth, replete with two bull sharks in formaldehyde titled Winner/Loser and a bar—Here For A Good Time Not a Long Time—that’s packed with medical waste. Pumped with all the cynicism one associates with a Martin Amis novel, Hirst’s ‘Empathy Suite’ is a sick thought designed to shock and boggle the heart. In Las Vegas, nothing in fact stays; everything is news. Damien Hirst’s Empathy Suite at Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas. Around a fire I relate the story of Hirst’s suite to Nurse. It’s my first getaway in six months. We were all held hostage, victims of a ‘class suicide’ and successful plot to bankrupt not only a national economy but human feeling, family, the need for hugs. In short, empathy. That Hirst should baptise his suite so calculatedly and so wrongly is a bilious reminder of how perverse words have become. Of course, one can ‘laugh it off’, as Nurse has done, but sick wit cannot dispel the fact that ours is a venal and heartless age in which revisionism — throwing good will after bad — is little too late. I think Duiker would agree. I recall the two of us in a bar in Noordhoek a few months before he killed himself. We were at the Miramax Scriptwriting Workshop. Medicated to the gills, he was nevertheless utterly alert and warm. There was a fullness there, despite the shot rigging. He must have known, despite his gentle modesty, that his ballsy, brilliant, overwritten novel would last forever. That his name would be consecrated in a mountain retreat is another matter. Nothing Hirst ever created could warrant such grace, though Nurse informs me that his personal encounter with the insufferable brat was heartening. They’d met in a rehab centre in Cape Town where Hirst’s girlfriend was billeted, and Nurse worked as a councillor. Cape Town is a rehab mecca. I once met a man in a café in Observatory who’d quit New York for Cape Town in a desperate attempt to save his nose, whose function and form had been destroyed by coke. Gentle, elegant, and tragic, he spoke to me of Buddha. Reflecting on this meld of addiction and grace, it seems a fallible compound of a gone era. Today one is exercised by or subject to extremes. Grace is a dead idea. As is empathy. There is no relief from hypocrisy, cruelty, rage. Hirst’s ‘Empathy Suite’ sums up the callowness and callousness of our age. Kemang Wa Lehulere, Once bitten, twice shy [Detail], 2016. Salvaged school desks, dentures, gold-leaf-covered books, steel Nurse tells me that when he is not in Bainskloof he lives in a complex in Muizenberg, which he manages. He is, as they say, a ‘people person’. His neighbour is Kemang wa Lehulere, which intrigues me, given that I’d chatted with Wa Lehulere at Café Ganesh the night before. Despite my disgust in the face of a global inhumanity, I was profoundly moved by the artist’s ability to coax self-belief in a young tech whizz. Wa Lehulere listens, emboldens, restores heart. But as Nurse informs me, he is also a terrible parker, his vehicle out of joint, overstepping the grid, wild in its disregard for propriety and form, which is unsurprising, given his art and vision. I’ll be visiting the artist’s studio when I get back to the city. Now, however, it is Nurse who holds my attention. Nurse has just emerged into the lounge to settle by the fire, having read the book he hands to me, How To Change Your Mind, The New Science of Psychedelics by Michael Pollan who, ‘under the influence of toad venom, becomes convinced he’s giving birth to himself.’ The sentiment is fitting: what else is left to do? Given a global rage that has metastasized, how does one nurture, engender, self-create? If there is precious little room to translate a good feeling — if ours is a time tin-eared, tone deaf, bereft of subtlety — imbibing some toad venom is clearly a good thing. For all my gloom, my rabid despair, I cannot fault the need for decency, kindness, grace. It’s why I’m installed in my personal empathy suite, K Sello, huddled about a fire, mountain water pounding through the gully beneath. Laugh It Off’s infamous Black Labour spoof t-shirt Between 2000 and 2005, Nurse was embroiled in a now legendary legal battle which centred on his spoofing of twenty brands, most notoriously his tagline, ‘BLACK LABOUR WHITE GUILT.’ A riff on SAB’s beer, Black Label, Nurse was charged with ‘hate speech’, of ‘not exercising freedom of expression but abusing it.’ It’s day two of my stay and we are seated on deck overlooking the thudding river, fluffy blankets about our shoulders. ‘Satire is still a form of art I guess,’ Nurse muses, though he remains uncertain. Ours is a humourless time; ‘brand spoofing passe.’ He had ‘more gumption and stomach then.’ We all did. ‘Now there’s no way of saying things without being castrated.’ Still, ‘against cancel culture and trolling we need healthy conversation.’ And if this seems well-nigh impossible, there’s always Nurse’s mountain retreat, where the ‘silence is so loud, the water so cold.’ Nurse has ‘an appetite for life.’ He plans to transform Bainskloof into a ‘lockdown pop-up space for art that inspires change.’ Peter van Straten is a much-loved favourite because of the artist’s humour and the beauty of the execution. As we speak, McBains is undergoing a face-lift, its exterior walls transformed by two street artists, Sven Christian and Martin Lund. Christian is working on a tribute to Paul du Toit who, prior to his death, took his oxygen tank with him on a final getaway to an island in the Indian Ocean. Alongside the painting, Christian has added Du Toit’s words from a scrapbook — ‘No one is going to do it for you.’ The sentiment is bracing, especially now that we are all indentured, co-opted, denied the right to speak our minds. But there, in that mountain retreat in Bainskloof — its access road built by prisoners and engineered by Andrew Geddes Bain (1797–1864) — it seems as if it’s still possible, even if Nurse has doubts as to what can and can’t be spoofed. K Sello Duiker, universally celebrated, and Paul du Toit, still maligned by art snobs, live on. Answering his own question — ‘How important is art in these times?’ — Nurse reminds us that art, and the life we create to make it possible, still ‘inspires change,’ if you have the ‘appetite.’ Here I find myself returning to Nurse’s best-known slogan, ‘BLACK LABOUR WHITE GUILT’. Its currency persists, though who, supposedly, has the right to speak in its name skews the slogan’s integrity. As Christian reminds me, ‘white guilt obstructs the possibility of actually acknowledging or dealing with indentured black labour. The target of that slogan is whiteness; Hirst’s suite and brand.’ But I can’t help thinking about another slogan, engineered by a UK PR company in 2014, which cynically chose to exploit rather than address guilt — White Monopoly Capital. The phrase is on all of our tongues these days. Its objective is to entrench division, not resolve it. If Nurse’s barb is heartfully witty, this one is chilling. It’s the final morning of my stay. With my dog Mica in tow, I walk along the winding tarred road. Mist greets me and swirls away, the rocky flank to my right awash with mountain water. The sky steadily parts. Why be gloomy on God’s day?</description>

      <title>COLLECT: Notions of Home</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/interviews/collect-notions-of-home</link>
      <description>COLLECT: NOTIONS OF HOME This week our curators at Latitudes turn their attention to a curated selection of work made primarily under the varying and ongoing lockdown restrictions. With little or no access to their studios, many artists were forced into new strategies of making and thinking, as manifest in the largely domestic scenes evidenced in this body of work. Notions of the domestic, the personal, the habitual and even just simply that which is readily available to hand in that unique hybrid of home/studio – have informed artistic creation within the context of other restrictions and limitations throughout art history. Domestic life has been a fundamental source of inspiration for artists faced with financial limitations, sickness and even brutal weather. Vincent Van Gogh&apos;s still lives made in the face of limited financial resources, George Pemba&apos;s hospital drawings created post-surgery for a burst appendix or Lucian Freud&apos;s self-portraits made largely out of necessity as that was the only model he could afford, all attest to artistic strategies within contexts defined by limitation. Oscillating between portraiture and still lives, the works selected here visualise newfound domestic homescapes – both as responses to, and as direct functions of an invisible pandemic. Evidencing new takes on genre painting – from Wessel Hamman&apos;s sidewalk cafe Prego rolls seen under the new optic of the pandemic; to that ample banana on the kitchen table as monumentalised by Sanell Aggenbach; and on to Callan Grecia and John Madu&apos;s heartfelt odes to night clubs so missed – these are registers of both everyday domesticity, as well as love songs to those pleasures whose absence is felt so strongly under the varying and ongoing restrictions of the COVID-19 lockdowns. &quot;Although genre painting appears to reproduce everyday life, in fact, it renders a version of it shaped according to certain social, political or class imperatives… in other words, it employs a realistic style to create a fantasy of private life&quot;.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/interviews/guest-curator-luvuyo-equiano-nyawose</link>
      <description>Guest Curator: Luvuyo Equiano Nyawose Photography by Andrea Kloppers An artist, curator, filmmaker, researcher and sessional lecturer based in Cape Town, Luvuyo Equiano Nyawose brings thoughtfulness and consideration to everything he does. He also fosters community wherever he goes. This might be a result of his training as a filmmaker and its highly collaborative processes. Since graduating with a BA HONS in film at AFDA, he has been working on his curating chops which began with an Honours Degree in Curatorship from UCT’s Centre for Curating the Archive. After a year interning at the Iziko South African National Gallery in 2019, he now sits as a member of UCT’s Works of Art Committee which is responsible for the curation and acquisitions of the university’s art collection. An artist himself, Luvuyo is currently pursuing his Masters in Fine Arts at Michaelis and is a Creative Knowledge Resources Postgraduate Fellow. His master&apos;s work ‘eBhish’ is an investigation of Black life and Black leisure ebhish’ laseThekwini (commonly known as the Durban beachfront). Luvuyo is also one third of Re-curators Curatorial Collective with Amogelang Maledu and Thembi Matroshe who are working on a group exhibition opening at the AVA in Cape Town next month. We’re excited to have his keen eye glance over the Latitudes artworks to make a selection which means something to him. Yolanda Mazwana , A.M.D II, 2021 Mixed media in canvas. Presented by Kalashnikovv Gallery . ENQUIRE . Brett Charles Seiler , Throat, 2020 Bitumen and roof paint on canvas. Presented by the gallery . ENQUIRE. Kgotlelelo Sekiti , Answer, 2019 Presented by TMRW Gallery . ENQUIRE . Helena Uambembe , Untitled (On the Wall), 2020 Waterproof Canvas, Tulle, Poly Satin, Cotton Thread.

Mongezi Ncaphayi , Wisdom Of Uncertainty, 2019 Etching. Presented by Artist Proof Studio . ENQUIRE . Nandipha Mntambo , Meditation, 2020 Cowtail on cotton. Presented by Everard Read Gallery . ENQUIRE . What kind of art are you drawn to personally? At the core, I’m drawn to artwork which is nuanced and traverses rigid didactic depictions and subject matters — artwork which probes, speculates and fabulates. What underlines your curatorial projects? My curatorial approach is rooted in centering Black and queer cultural production and thought. Through the Re-curators Curatorial Collective we seek to collaborate and highlight artists, scholars and writers whose individual nuanced contributions and conceptual merit is rooted in a decolonial praxis — practitioners who make us rethink art production, queer archives and reclaim it from the clutches of the western-heteronormative, patriarchal canon. What do you enjoy about the process of curating? As a young curator, collaboration, community, conversation, experimentation and speculation are key to my curatorial process. Please tell us about your selection from Latitudes: is there a golden thread? The selection consists of artwork which I was personally drawn to. To put it simply the thread is a dynamic conversation through form, abstraction, medium, materiality and composition between established artists and emerging artists. Follow Luvuyo’s many creative outputs and practices on Instagram .</description>

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/interviews/latitudes-sits-down-with-artist-phumulani-ntuli</link>
      <description>Latitudes sits down with artist Phumulani Ntuli ----------- Phumulani Ntuli in studio working on a large scale collage on canvas, courtesy David Krut Projects Latitudes Online (LO): What piqued your interest in art and how did you realise your practice from there? Phumulani Ntuli (PN): My journey into the world of art commenced in my early years when I discovered my ability to draw. Utilising images as references became a common practice for my pencil sketches. This revelation occurred during my time in sub-B (grade 2) when my biology teacher assigned us the task of illustrating human anatomy, focusing on hands, faces, torsos, and limbs. The assignment, which we carried out over the weekend, required meticulous attention to detail as I studied my references intently. Upon submission, I didn&apos;t anticipate much significance, but to my surprise, my teacher was captivated by my artistic skill. She summoned another teacher to inspect my drawing, leaving me momentarily anxious, thinking I might be in trouble. However, it turned out that I was being recognized for my talent. This experience boosted my confidence, prompting me to share my sketches with others, particularly at family gatherings. I even ventured into creating portraits of family members. This artistic journey gained momentum, thanks to the encouragement of my late friend, Themba Ziphilele Moyake. Although he explored drawing and painting, he ultimately pursued African literature at Wits, leaving me to delve deeper into the realm of art. Attending seminars at Wits during my free time exposed me to academic papers and presentations, all while I maintained a full-time position in retail. This period of self-education enlightened me about university-level academic programs, leading me to apply to the University of Johannesburg after completing my undergrad. Embarking on various projects, my first residency at Bag Factory marked a significant step in my artistic pursuits. Subsequently, I pursued an MFA in Switzerland, kept afloat by a partial scholarship I was fortunate to receive. Phumulani Ntuli, Prompt search from a generative console, R 26,086.96 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: As I understand it, your practice explores notions of black futurity and the archive - and to quote Lukanyo Mbanga “a futurist is a historian by default”. What is the significance of this intersection between past and future and how is it represented in your work? PN: South African artmaking grapples with the shadows cast by its political history, an imprint evident in artworks mirroring the prevailing societal norms—a long-standing, one-size-fits-all approach. I contend that history, tainted as it may be, permeates the archive, and, as an artist, my perpetual endeavour is to demystify the structure within this archival framework. My exploration often navigates the realms of film and documentary practices, revealing the potential for fictionalisation within digital art forms like film and photography. On one hand, there is a probing of the media itself, utilising it as a departure point to conjure the absent elements and scenes. On the other hand, there exists a reconsideration of the media as an empowering instrument. In my artistic process, I sketch landscapes, reference various sources, and capture photographs, and appropriate images from open archives. This amalgamation of processes occasionally disrupts the pathways to visualisation, mirroring the interference of social media in our interpersonal connections and presence. Amidst these futuristic flights through such interferences, the aim is to render visible the obscured references in this operation and explore novel avenues for image generation that empower, rather than regress. The futurist strives to integrate and reconcile the media, drawing upon an extensive array of infrastructures. Viewing these modes of practice as open source, akin to open archive images, the futurist treats them as collective geographies, even if they risk decommissioning. The futurist appropriates and deaccessions these archives, incorporating them into their work. Indeed, I agree with the fact that the futurist is a historian who engages in speculation, drawing, and animating the past events in the future tense. Phumulani Ntuli, Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), on show until 26 January 2024, book to visit now LO: As a multidisciplinary artist, how has your practice evolved over the last few years? What intrigues you and gives you creative direction? PN: I am passionate about the emergence of innovative technologies in development, open-source platforms, the evolution of user interfaces, and immersive experiences. The potential of new media and its intersection with traditional art-making practices captivates me. This convergence is evident in various forms, such as software, Image Generation AI, and tools designed to simplify image production. Despite this, there exists a hesitation in recognising new media art-making as a process-based activity, with these technologies often seen as post-production tools. Take, for instance, digital images and their analogues. While they are typically encapsulated when viewed online, the metadata, code biases, and underlying architecture shaping these digital images remain unnoticed. It&apos;s crucial to acknowledge how these elements influence content manipulation and form. Phumulani Ntuli, Point Cloud, R 135,582.61 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY These reflections drive my creative impulse. I am constantly exploring alternative ways to navigate the online space, steering away from conventional social media platforms. This exploration spans open-source platforms, software, and unconventional practices for visualising and manipulating images. Moreover, I actively engage in collaborative efforts with developers within my collective practice, leveraging insights gained as research processes or as integral components of new artistic work. LO: You are an artist who strives for independence in your practice. What about this is so important to you? PN: During my formative years as a young artist, the prevailing trend in Johannesburg was for artists to consign with galleries, curators, or project spaces. This meant actively seeking opportunities that aligned with their artistic vision or responding to invitations that came their way. This approach was widespread among many emerging artists in Johannesburg, and I believe it continues to be the norm. Independent practices, often manifesting in collective studios or project spaces—examples being the late Assemblage Studios and the current Bag Factory Artists Studio—constitute a significant and enduring model within the professional art-making landscape. Within this artistic milieu, discussions revolve around project-based practices, collaborations, residencies, and pop-up exhibitions, among other avenues. For many emerging artists, adopting this mode of operation has become almost intuitive, providing a means to showcase their work and gain visibility within the art world. Independent practices typically involve navigating from one project to the next, sometimes engaging in collaborative efforts while also carving out time for individual pursuits. This operational template became a standard for me early on, and I now find myself more at ease and confident in working this way. Opening night at Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), featured monotypes by Phumulani Ntuli on show until 26 January 2024, book to visit now It&apos;s worth noting that embracing independent practices doesn&apos;t necessarily preclude being associated with established institutions. Many artists aspire to have a presence in such spaces. For me, the concept of independent practice evolved organically, influenced by the direction my career was taking. Faced with a particular set of circumstances, I had to make choices—whether to prioritise my own artistic endeavours, collaborate with fellow practitioners, or actively seek opportunities aligned with my ethical values in the art business. LO: What would you advise other artists who wish to remain independent? What have been some of your biggest learnings and challenges along the way? PN: Firstly, I believe most artists aspire to establish stability in their careers. While the idea of being part of a stable environment is often inherent in an artist&apos;s mindset, navigating the independent route requires actively seeking and seizing opportunities that align with one&apos;s vision. Despite the challenges of maintaining independence, such as juggling multiple roles, it is important to handle these tasks efficiently to strike a balance between creative expression and business responsibilities. Maintaining a clear intention is equally vital. Drawing from my personal experience, I registered a business and took deliberate steps to acquire the necessary skills for its operation. Leveraging my background in administration, I honed my business management skills. This strategic approach ensures that both the creative drive and the business aspects complement each other harmoniously. Secondly, building a successful art career is a long-term endeavour. The concept of development remains pertinent throughout an artist&apos;s journey, even for established individuals who continually evolve their work. Engaging in meaningful collaborations within and beyond the art world is essential. This extends to professional partnerships with individuals such as lawyers, accountants, and web developers, broadening the artist&apos;s network and enhancing their overall professional framework. LO: What tools and practices are essential to your success as an independent artist? PN: Over the years, I&apos;ve come to realise that establishing an independent artistic practice demands a diverse skill set encompassing both creative and administrative abilities. Not every artist possesses the inclination for paperwork, and the tendency to avoid it can have significant drawbacks. Therefore, I believe it&apos;s crucial for artists to acknowledge the importance of honing skills beyond their creative talents. In my perspective, successful independent practice hinges on collaboration and the ability to define collaboration terms, recognising that these terms vary with each opportunity. Another essential component is the development of an integrated business model and plan, a task that undoubtedly requires a certain proficiency in writing. This proficiency becomes instrumental in crafting and presenting proposals effectively. While pursuing education in an academic institution can offer numerous benefits, it is by no means the sole path to cultivating a sustainable artistic practice. However, engaging in academic pursuits can elevate one&apos;s thinking about their craft, providing a structured environment for personal and artistic growth. I highly recommend considering this avenue, as it can serve as a valuable time to seek mentorship, explore strategies for positioning oneself in the art world, and broaden one&apos;s perspective on artistic endeavours. Phumulani Ntuli at Latitudes Centre for the Arts (LCA), on show until 26 January 2024, book to visit now LO: In what way does a relationship with an organisation such as Latitudes help to bolster your independence? PN: I had the privilege of collaborating with Ruzy Rusike, who curated my exhibition at the Bag Factory in 2021. She introduced me to Roberta Coci as part of the marketing strategy for my exhibition. This collaboration took place as we were emerging from the lockdown, bringing with it both new insights and lingering anxieties, making it an undoubtedly challenging period. During this time, I actively engaged with the Latitudes platform, seizing all the possibilities it offered with Ruzy&apos;s valuable assistance. Latitudes, functioning as an intermediary, creates a bridge between artists and collectors, as well as institutions. This connection can be particularly challenging to establish independently. The organisation serves as a crucial third party, facilitating access to a broader audience. Maintaining a strong relationship with Latitudes has the potential to yield positive outcomes in one&apos;s artistic career. The platform places artworks within reach of collectors and institutions, opening doors that might otherwise be difficult to access independently. A well-nurtured partnership with Latitudes can significantly impact an artist&apos;s trajectory in the art world. Phumulani Ntuli, Messages from a beacon, R 26,086.96 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY LO: As an artist who re-imagines new narratives and envisions future possibilities for what it means to be African, how do you envision the future of independent artistic practice and the arts ecosystem? PN: There is no doubt that independent artistic practice will persist within the art ecosystem, as evidenced by organisations like Bag Factory Artist’s Studio, which actively nurtures both established and emerging artists, and publishers like LL Editions that engage in ongoing collaborations with artists. It is crucial to recognize that the art ecosystem is expansive, extending beyond the confines of galleries, museums, project spaces, or institutions. All these spheres within the art ecosystem, strive to attain visibility by employing art as a catalyst for conversations, reflection, and the exploration of social relationships, as well as speculative ideas surrounding the human condition. The future of art creation is thrilling, with art undergoing transformational influences from social media platforms, new technologies, image generation models, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. One can choose to perceive these developments as opportunities or turn a blind eye, but in either case, individuals are prompted to reevaluate their positions within these new realms of fiction. Importantly, these innovative practices need not compromise social justice. The intersection of art with social media and technology can coexist harmoniously with a commitment to freedom.</description>

Art materials, from high-quality paints and canvases to sculpting tools and digital equipment, are often prohibitively expensive, especially for emerging and independent artists. This fund seeks to bridge that gap, ensuring that lack of resources does not limit artistic potential and innovation. By empowering artists with access to the tools they need, we foster a vibrant and inclusive creative community where artistic voices from diverse backgrounds can thrive. Latitudes Limited was launched in 2019, and is a movement to make contemporary art from Africa accessible, inclusive and impactful. In line with this, every purchase of a Latitudes Limited multiple directly supports African artists, with a portion of proceeds feeding directly into the Latitudes&apos; Art Fund in partnership with META Foundation. Latitudes donates 10% of the proceeds of a sale of a Latitudes Limited print and the featured artist has the choice to donate a further 10%. This makes each Latitudes Limited purchase an act of art patronage, in times when community is needed more than ever. Operating through an application-based process, which will open in March 2026, artists can apply for grants on a rolling basis. Selection criteria will include artistic merit, financial need, and the potential impact of the fund on the artist&apos;s career. In doing so, the Art Fund not only promotes creative growth but also strengthens the larger art ecosystem by supporting artists at their foundation; their tools and materials. Photography credit: Willem Potgieter A selection committee from the META foundation and Latitudes will select the winners. The grant values will be the same (an amount decided on based on the amount of money in the fund). The META foundation will then manage the payment of the grants to the art supplier ensuring that each winning applicant receives a voucher for their amount. The fund seeks investment through art sales on Latitudes Online and direct donations. Latitudes is to facilitate these sales and donations with all monies managed by META foundation - a registered PBO. Any individuals or companies donating funds are eligible for an income tax write off to the value of the donation. The META foundation will issue these. 27 Nov 2024</description>

      <description>In recent years, the “ludic turn” has moved from an emerging tendency to a discernible cultural condition. Across the Global South and beyond, curatorial agendas, institutional commissions, and market-facing exhibitions have increasingly foregrounded play, both as a conceptual proposition and as an operative methodology.</description>

Checkers, DisChem, Faithful to Nature, Natural Options, Pick ‘n Pay, and selected Spars. www.annapureorganic.co.za @annapureorganic The artist residency is the result of an exciting partnership between Latitudes, ANNA and Southern African Foundation For Contemporary Art ( SAFFCA ). Residency information One of the Top 12 ANNA Award finalists will be invited to one of five beautiful residency locations including, Lion Sands Ivory Lodge, Sabi Sands in Mpumalanga, UNESCO World Heritage site Witklipfontein, The Entabeni Urban Farm in Knysna, Abbaye de la Cambre in Brussels and the Gallery MOMO Residency in Johannesburg. Please note: the location of the residency for 2025 is subject to several considerations and will be a discussion at the time of the announcement. Residency offerings Lion Sands x The MORE Family Collection Artist Residency The MORE Family Collection in Partnership with SAFFCA has launched an artist residency program. Arising out of the earth and blending into the landscape, the award-winning Lion Sands Ivory Lodge in Sabi Sand, Mpumalanga, was inspired by its breath-taking natural surroundings. The design is both a reflection and an incorporation of the African bush, treading lightly and honoring the space it occupies on the banks of the Sabie River. The residency at the lodge serves as a gallery and studio, welcoming participants to live, work, and interact within this unique environment. Stays of up to six weeks allow individuals to draw unparalleled inspiration from the location and wildlife sightings, fostering the creation of new pieces while also providing a platform forshowcasing their work. With the intention to promote South African art, in collaboration with SAFFCA, and nurture emerging talent, MORE Family Collection initiated the residency in 2021. The concept resonates with the desire among travellers worldwide for meaningful, immersive, and experiential experiences. Guests have the opportunity to engage with the talented residents, gaining insights into their creative processes and potentially acquiring original, collectible artwork. “Historically, we have alwayssupported local artists,” explains MORE CEO Robert More. “Our aim with the Artist Residency is to provide them with a dedicated space to focus on their craft while connecting with an appreciative audience. For our guests, this offers an enriching and distinctive experience that enhances their stay at Lion Sands Ivory Lodge.&quot; Witklipfontein Witklipfontein stands as one of the original farms within The Vredefort Dome, a UNESCO World Heritage site. In 2013, the Huyberechts Family realised their dream of owning a farm in Africa, driven by a desire to reconnect with nature and the fundamental aspects of life. Since then, they have dedicated themselves to enhancing this natural haven, establishing a bountiful vegetable garden and constructing decent housing for the workers, serving as a prototype for future residency spaces. Encompassing 215 hectares of diverse landscapes including plains, hills, a kloof, a spruit, and dams, the farm exudes breathtakingbeauty and tranquillity, evoking a profound sense of peace and well-being. The environment evolves harmoniously with the changing seasons, transitioning from the lush greenery of summer, occasionally refreshed by gentle rains, to the dry, golden hues of winter, marked by stark light and crisp temperatures. The studio at Witklipfontein is equipped with an array of construction tools, easels, and trestle tables for artists&apos; use. Creatives are encouraged to explore the farm&apos;s soil for natural pigments or clay work, with the option to craft homemade paints under Michael&apos;s expert guidance. A pottery kiln is conveniently situated at the manager&apos;s house. The residency fosters a deliberate disconnection from the frenetic pace of the outside world, with no Wi-Fi provided within the residence. However, artists are welcome to utilise their own data in designated areas to maintain connectivity. Additionally, guests are invited to indulge in a refreshing swim at the main lodge when it is unoccupied. In essence, Witklipfontein Residence offers artists a serene and inspirational setting, nurturing a profound connection with nature and facilitating a deep exploration of their creative endeavours. Entabeni Urban Farm Residency In pure Knysna spirit, we are igniting a passion in art. Greg and Lizette Barnes are the inspiration behind the concept of Entabeni Urban Farm. In their own words: ‘Our second half-century of life marks the beginning of our legacy phase. Entabeni is our opportunity to give back, serve, and create joy, meaning and fulfilment for others. We are fortunate to combine our strengths, experience and passion and create something memorable, meaningful and lasting for future generations and the community embarking on this life adventure with us. Uganda-born Benon Lutaayawas the first artist to experience life on Entabeni Farm. His sense of hope, opportunity and optimism still lingers around every corner of Hudson Manor. He taught us that nothing is ever wasted and that everything has a place in this world. Art is often-co-created with the environment. Many artists have created artworks influenced by experiencing the devastation, destruction and hope after the Kynsna fires of 2017. We have had the pleasure of hosting Chris Soal, Barbara Schroeder, Chrisel Attewell, Minnette Vari, Pauline Gutter, Clement Garnung, Greatjoy Ndlovu, Luc Detot, Kinelwe Makoena, Helena Hugo, Nompumelelo Vuyiswa Tshabalala, Mbongeni Fakudze Eric Chabrely, Asemahle Ntlonti, Petra Schutte, Thando Salman, Mfundo Mthiyane, Bambolwami Sibiya, Ttayob Moosa, Kyra Pape and Arina van Der Merwe. We’re a proud member of SAFFCA. SAFFCA.EU in Brussels Residency The aim of this residency is for the artist to use this time in a truly special location in Brussels to inter alia experiment, develop new ideas and/or techniques, venture in new avenues and engage in multicultural conversations through the art practice. Brussels is today the most cosmopolitan city in the world after Dubai and therefore an ideal place for the latter. Art is and has been cherished in Brussels for a long time. As you probably know, Belgium is the country which has the biggest number of artcollectors per capita in the world. SAFFCA.EUis located in Ixelles within walking distance of many amenities and is in the centre of a strong socio-economic diversity. Furthermore some 148 languages are spoken in Ixelles. The fabulous and historic site of the Abbey is also in a way the tip end of the forest penetrating into the city. The Abbey developments started in 1201. The area was then outside Brussels like ‘Saint Germain des Prés’ was once outside Paris. Your residency should be a rich time of inner exploration, and we, as a team, will help the artist in whatever way we can to assist you within our limits. The artist will be able to develop her/his art practice in her/his own studio while having many multicultural conversations around the subject of “art-making” with the other artists working in our space at that time. The studio space and accommodation are fully provided for at : 17 Abbaye de la Cambre,1050 Bruxelles Gallery MOMO Residency In an exciting development, SAFFCA is proud to announce its partnership with Gallery MOMO, as they delve into the residency program together set to launch this year 2023. Residency@MOMO was established in 2006. The residency has two spacious work areas and can accommodate three individual artists at a time. It is primarily for visiting international artists and curators across any arts discipline, including visual and performing artists, writers, and filmmakers. The residency program was founded by its neighbouring gallery to enable work and social engagement between international and South African artists, as well as to encourage experimentation and exchange. Not all residencies result directly in exhibitions or events, though some manifestation of work is encouraged, with the emphasis being on the opportunity to live, work, and connect in Johannesburg. Residencies are non-prescriptive and process-based, allowing visiting artists to develop projects in response to their new environment, or to conduct research. The residency has a Utopian philosophy that provides a ‘big space’ for art and creation. 25 Jun 2025 .m-article__header, .m-article__feature-image { display: none !important; }</description>

Her mediums include photography, writing and pen on paper drawing. She started photography in order to preserve her culture and understand her identity. Her works explore individual storytelling through an intersection of surrealism and chiaroscuro. She aims to express deep seated emotions and cultural values through storytelling in effective and exciting ways. Kinika’s work also highlights femininity, beauty and fashion and is deeply inspired by cinema and baroque techniques which involves the play of light and shadows to further dramatize her subjects and drive her story. She expresses her personal struggles, passion and joy as well as those found around her in her daily life with the use of photographs. Kinika has showcased her work in both local and international group exhibitions such as Polaroid x Magnum Real Life is not Black &amp; White, Paris Photo Fair and Divergence, 1952 Africa, Lagos Nigeria. Kinika has participated in two art residencies which are Divergence, 1952 Art Accelerator Programme. Lagos, Nigeria and Alternative Heritage by StoryMi x French Embassy in Nigeria x The Republic Magazine. Ibadan, Nigeria. &quot;It feels deeply exhilarating, and I am grateful to be part of this.&quot; - Aleruchi Kinika Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 BROWSE HER WORK Amy Rusch Amy Rusch is an artist working across disciplines and mediums. She’s been exploring a vibrational expression of mark-making, using stitched thread into layers of found plastic bags. ”Cutting, stitching, heating, pulling, binding, gathering, layering – these practices demand their own rhythm, by turns slow and meticulous then quick, fast interventions. The motions enacted in making provide a retrospective link to the embodied experiences, transmuted in the process. The machine stitching into plastic is not about replicating an experience, an object, or anything formally understood. The process is about sitting with the remnants of man-made materials; human time in contrast to the elemental and deep time.” Recent exhibitions include presentations at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair 2025 and FNB Art Joburg 2024 with Suburbia Contemporary. Amy presented a solo body of work with SMAC gallery in 2022 titled Seeing with a Listening Ear, a culmination of 3 years of making. She exhibited at the Norval Foundation as part of the Norval Sovereign African Art Prize 2023 finalists exhibition. She has shown work at the Pretoria Art Museum, Iziko South African National Gallery as well as the Zeitz MOCAA. &quot;As an artist whose practice began with threads passed down from my maternal great grandmother and the female makers in our family, It&apos;s an extraordinary honour for this to be validated by being selected as a finalist for the ANNA award. Working with these threads feels like it&apos;s keeping a lineage alive.&quot; - Amy Rusch Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 BROWSE HER WORK Azola Kingston Azola Kingston is a self-taught visual artist born in 1994 in Philadelphia, USA, and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. Her work is a bold celebration of Blackness. Through vibrant colour and layered composition, she honours the richness of African life - its people, its traditions, its spirit. Her current range explores the idea of a seat at the table: not as invitation, but as affirmation. Her work insists that African art, stories, and voices are central to the cultural conversation, not because they echo others, but because they carry their own undeniable weight. She draws beauty from community: shared meals, everyday rituals, generational wisdom, unspoken knowing. Her work brings light to the untold narratives of Black and African contribution, ones that deserve not only to be acknowledged, but celebrated. Each piece tells a story that’s been waiting to be seen: a story of pride, presence and power. It doesn’t whisper. It doesn’t wait. It arrives. Vivid, vital, and impossible to ignore. “Being an ANNA Awards finalist affirms that the way I honour our lives, in bold colour and unapologetic truth, has weight. These stories aren’t just mine. They’re echoes of a greater beauty, long overlooked, now impossible to ignore. The ANNA Awards remind me that what I create isn’t just seen. It’s felt and it belongs. - Azola Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 4 BROWSE HER WORK Chigozie Obi Chigozie Obi (b. 1997) is a multidimensional artist whose practice engages various materials to narrate stories influenced by personal and societal encounters. Themes such as the complexities and simplicity of human life, interpretations of beauty, cultural and societal narratives especially concerning women, mental health, activism, community, documentation, self-acceptance and healing deeply resonate with her and are reflected in her work. These themes are not only reflective of her personal journey but also serve as a bridge to connect with others who share similar experiences. Obi obtained a bachelors degree of Visual Arts from the Creative Arts department, University of Lagos in 2017. Her work has been featured in several exhibitions and fairs, which include, ‘1-54 Marrakech’, Morocco (2025), ‘In Stillness of Being’, Yenwa Gallery, Lagos, Nigeria (2024), ‘Celebrating Identities’, AG18 Gallery, Vienna, Austria (2024), ‘Young Talents: Polymathic Nature’, C+N Gallery CANEPANERI, Genoa, Italy (2023), ‘Future Fair’, New York (2023), ‘Unity’, Vollery Gallery, Dubai (2022), &apos;Intersections’, Gallery Affinity, Lagos, Nigeria (2021). She won the Access Bank &apos;Art X Prize’ (2021), is one of the winners of The Future Awards Prize For Art (2021) and was a residency artist at Gasworks, London (April - June 2022). “I feel thankful and honoured to be selected as an ANNA Award finalist, recognition is always a nice reminder that my work is paying off and resonates with others.&quot; - Chigozie Obi Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 4 BROWSE HER WORK Chinecherem Peace Ifedilichukwu Chinecherem is a community-based textile artist whose practice serves as both a creative outlet and a reflective space for acknowledging personal emotions and the lived realities of women. Her journey into the world of art began when she was offered admission to study Fine and Applied Arts, a pivotal moment that awakened a profound and enduring passion. In 2017, she graduated as the Best Graduating Student in the Department of Industrial Design (Textile) at the School of Arts, Design, and Printing Technology, Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu. Her work has been featured in numerous exhibitions, including the 2025 Kuenyehia Prize for Contemporary Art Exhibition, Lagos, 2025 “Patronage”, +234 Art fair Exhibition, Lagos, 2025 Rele Arts Foundation Young Contemporaries Exhibition, Lagos and the 2021 My View From the Other Side: Dreams/Reality exhibition at the Embassy of Spain, Abuja.Winner 2024 Kuenyehia Prize for Contemporary Art, Ghana. She is also a 2024 Fellow of both the Rele Arts Foundation Young Contemporaries Residency in Ekiti State and the Kuta Art Residency in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Chinecherem’s practice continues to evolve as a dynamic dialogue between tradition and innovation; personal narrative and collective memory each work a testament to the power of art in preserving identity and inspiring transformation. “Being shortlisted is a moment of recognition, an invitation for others to experience my work, understand my perspective, and step into my world of creativity and expression and I’m deeply honored to be counted among such inspiring talents.&quot; - Chinecherem Peace Ifedilichukwu Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 BROWSE HER WORK Dina Nomena Dina Nomena Andriarimanjaka is a Malagasy visual artist, designer, and researcher whose transdisciplinary practice bridges memory, textile, and resistance. Rooted in an Afrofeminist and decolonial approach, her work explores untold stories, particularly those of women, through archival fragments, fabric remnants, embroidery, and poetic storytelling. Her creations embody a slow, conscious process, sewing, weaving, layering, reflecting care, transmission, and the intimate link between textile and identity. Often inspired by Malagasy matrimony (women’s heritage) and cultural rituals, her installations create a space for dialogue between past and present, individual and collective memory. &quot;To be an ANNA Award finalist is to receive a space to silent stories, to stitch presence where absence once reigned. It is a recognition that the forgotten women I honour through thread and fabric were there, and are still here, speaking softly through every layer, every seam.&quot; - Dina Nomena Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 BROWSE HER WORK Doaa Fakher Doaa Fakher is a contemporary Egyptian artist born in Cairo in 1992. She holds a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Art Education from Cairo University (2012) and a Master’s degree in African Arts from Helwan University (2020), where she researched major challenges facing Africa. Her work explores human and societal issues, often depicting anonymous, distorted figures that reflect emotional and psychological states shaped by social injustice. Using thick layers of acrylic and oil paint, silkscreen, and occasional sculpture, Fakher expresses internal emotions through the human body as a symbol of vulnerability and resilience. Her artistic practice was shaped by studying African artists who critically addressed their continent and diaspora experiences, merging these perspectives with her own context in North Africa. Fakher has participated in many national and international exhibitions, including the Youth Salon at Cairo Opera House (2016–2017), the Luxor International Painting Symposium, the AKAA Art Fair in Paris (2021), and the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair in London and Marrakech (2020). She has held solo shows at Townhouse Gallery (2018) and Ubuntu Art Gallery (2023, 2025). Her work has earned multiple awards and is part of the Museum of Modern Egyptian Art collection. She is represented by Ubuntu Art Gallery in Cairo. &quot;Being selected as a finalist for the ANNA Award is a quiet reminder that when the inner voice is shared through art, it can open space for dialogue across borders. I believe painting is a space to reflect, to face what cannot be fixed, and to give form to social pain — not as a solution, but as an honest presence. As an Egyptian artist working from the heart of Cairo, I take the human being as the measure of all things, and I search for shared meaning within the uncertain, complex condition of being alive.&quot; - Doaa Fakher Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 BROWSE HER WORK Fetlework Tadesse Fetlework Tadesse, also known as Fela, was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. She graduated from Entoto Technical and Vocational Education Training College with a diploma in Fine Arts specialising in sculpture in 2004. Later, she pursued painting at Addis Ababa University Ale School of Fine Arts and Design, where she obtained a Bachelor&apos;s Degree in painting in 2019. Fela has actively participated in various group exhibitions since 2004, showcasing her work at prestigious venues such as the Ethiopian National Theatre, Ethiopian National Museum, Ethiopian Royal Palace, and Entoto Fine arts. She has also been featured in numerous events at Sheraton Addis Hotel, Hilton Hotel, and Skylight Hotel, as well as group art exhibitions at Red Door Art Gallery, Addis Fine Art, and Post Gallery. In 2023, Fela held her debut solo exhibition at Findika Cultural Center, and her artwork is represented by postgalleryet. She also showcased her work at Booth ALT 12 at the Investec Cape Town Art Fair in 2024. Fela had the honor of exhibiting her pieces in Ethiopia and internationally, including a duo solo show at the Addis Ababa Modern Art Museum (GKDM) in March 2025. Fela&apos;s artistic style is characterized by semi-realistic depictions using brush stroke techniques, often featuring self-portraits that reflect her attitude and daily life routine. She draws inspiration from observing everyday life, mundane patterns, body movements, fashion trends, and controversial ideas, which she incorporates into her art through question and answer sessions with herself. Colors, forms, and body gestures serve as key inspirations for her work, allowing her to explore anatomy and structure while painting emotions and attitudes. This July 18, 2025 she&apos;s part of “Roots and wings” a group exhibition at Stuttgart, Germany curated by Tesfaye Urgessa internationally acclaimed artist. &quot;I’m honoured to be chosen as a finalist. This recognition feels like a meaningful milestone in my artistic journey, and I&apos;m grateful for the opportunity it brings.&quot; - Fetlework Tadesse Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 BROWSE HER WORK Haneem Christian Haneem Christian is an archivist and filmmaker from Cape Town, South Africa exploring Pan African history through the lens of Queerness.

Being named an ANNA Award finalist is not only a witnessing of my practice, but an honouring of the legacy I&apos;ve inherited.&quot; - Haneem Christian Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 BROWSE HER WORK Naledi Maifala Naledi Maifala is a Botswana-based contemporary expressionist painter whose work explores stillness and contentment. She began painting in 2007 during her junior years and transitioned to professional art in 2022. Her artistic vision is rooted in the theme “Just as Petals Fall, Life Too Fades”—a metaphor for presence, impermanence, and the fleeting nature of life. Focusing on mind-soothing surroundings, her subjects include domestic animals, garden flowers, sentimental objects, and people who embody serenity. Fascinated by the journey of inner contentment, Naledi believes external surroundings can also stimulate this experience. With her photography skills, she captures moments of solitude, later translating them onto canvas with acrylic paints. Her brushstrokes balance intuition and intention, using light, texture, and colour to shape mood and storytelling. Naledi has participated in several group exhibitions in Botswana, including Dikgosigadi Exhibition, Women Create Love Exhibition, and Heart Scape in Nigeria, just to name a few. Through her work, she hopes to inspire appreciation for life’s simplicity, alleviating the pressures of constant striving. She envisions her art as a meditative space for spiritual, psychological, and emotional well-being. “Being a finalist means so much to me; it’s an affirmation of my voice, my vision, and the themes I explore, especially the idea of being present and content. It encourages me to keep creating from a place of stillness and truth. I’m honoured to be part of a platform that values inclusivity, care, and authentic expression.&quot; - Naledi Maifala Explore more of their practice on Latitudes Online 1 2 3 BROWSE HER WORK Reem Aljeally Reem Aljeally (b. 1997) is a multifaceted artist whose work integrates architecture, visual arts, and curation.

A deep care and focus on Matrilineal Methodologies: as an artistic value, spiritual practice and rituals that promote circularity through African Indigenous practices, linking ties between how cultures are both built and sustained, how indigenous stories are written down for eyes that can read the scaredness cultural and spiritual stewardship. Through the incorporation of African indigenous voices, perspectives and lived experiences as an indigenous science, they embody ways of knowing that are rooted in ancestral knowledge systems as valid as science. In the same ways our environments have adapted, our indigenous knowledge systems have adapted as a science in and of itself- an African indigenous science. “As Arundhati Roy says: &quot;Another world is not only possible, she is on her way.

      <description>In recent years, the “ludic turn” has moved from an emerging tendency to a discernible cultural condition. Across the Global South and beyond, curatorial agendas, institutional commissions, and market-facing exhibitions have increasingly foregrounded play, both as a conceptual proposition and as an operative methodology.</description>

      <description>It should be in the interest of any good institution to consistently question itself and its ways of working. In the case of the University of Johannesburg’s Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture (FADA), the question it’s asking itself is this: What kind of impact does our work have – on us, our students, our faculty, and the world around us?</description>

      <title>A COLLECTIVE NAVIGATION: SEASON 11 OF THE CENTRE FOR THE LESS GOOD IDEA</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/a-collective-navigation-season-11-of-the-centre-for-the-less-good-idea-1</link>
      <description>A COLLECTIVE NAVIGATION: SEASON 11 OF THE CENTRE FOR THE LESS GOOD IDEA - words by David Mann Sketch theatre works from The Unexpected City will be resta ged as part of Season 11. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi ---------------- In Maboneng, on the second floor of a factory-turned-arts hub, a visual artist and a dancer have a conversation through mark-making and movement, with ink splatters and footprints creating an abstract record of their encounter. Later, a group of musicians and performers gather downstairs to collectively view and respond to a silent film, creating an improvised and responsive score. Outside in the courtyard, actors run lines for sketch theatre productions inspired by the characters and stories of the city, while in the upstairs dance studio, a trio of artists devise a new work inspired by communal grief and loss. For the last few months, the interdisciplinary arts space, The Centre for the Less Good Idea, has been revisiting work it’s created over the last two years, and building towards its 11th Season. Taking place at The Centre from 26 to 30 November, Season 11 takes the form of a five-day festival of visual art, dance, theatre, site-specific installations, pop-up performances, and talks. EXPLORE THE PROGRAMME &amp; BOOK YOUR TICKETS A COLLECTIVE NAVIGATION Curated by composer, musician, installation artist and Impresario for the Less Good Idea, Neo Muyanga, and supported by The Centre’s core team, Season 11 focuses on work made by and in collaboration with Johannesburg’s many artists, theatremakers, musicians, writers, filmmakers, and thinkers, as well as a host of invited artists. In this way, many of The Centre’s key methodologies inform the Season – public performances and processions, the intersection of visual art and performance, short-form theatre, and curated conversations – but these ways of working have also evolved and deepened over the years. Specifically, it’s the act of collective seeing and shaping that runs through this Season. Mary Sibande will be one of the artists in Moving the Mark, a programme of visual artists and dancers in collaboration. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi All of this makes for a Season that asks its artists and audiences to reflect on the idea of collectivity, how we navigate the city and, by extension, the world, together. As Muyanga puts it: “It’s about how we become a performance ensemble, whether we are performers, audience members, or neighbours. It’s how the city performs itself through us, and also how we choose to perform the city. Johannesburg is a place that requires a collective navigation, a mutual reliance, a particular call and response.” William Kentridge will be one of the artists in Moving the Mark, a programme of visual artists and dancers in collaboration. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi Bronwyn Lace, co-founder and director of The Centre, echoes these sentiments, adding that Season 11 is, in part, a culmination of two years of provocations and experimental forms put forth by Muyanga. “The deeply integrated and interconnected results of these forms are evidence both of Muyanga’s extraordinary capacity for deep listening and play as well as The Centre’s capacity as a collective to develop context-specific, collaborative and cross-disciplinary new work,” says Lace. Alongside Muyanga’s curation over the last two years, which has seen programming interrogating a dramaturgy of sound, contemporary readings of the city, and collective ways of seeing and responding, there has been a growth and deepening of SO | the Academy for the Less Good Idea as a space of learning and sharing led by Athena Mazarakis, as well as an increase in the international opportunities for The Centre Outside the Centre, led by Lace. Opening Season 11 is Moving the Mark, a new programme pairing prominent visual artists and dancers towards a series of responsive, interdisciplinary experiments in movement and mark-making. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi. “I think of the Less Good Idea at this point as a multi-limbed complex organism – our arms reaching out in various directions but connected to the same robust body,” says Lace. “It makes sense for us to share a Season at the end of this year, because we have an abundance of new strategies, forms, and artworks to test, show, and celebrate.” MERGING VISUAL ART AND DANCE Opening Season 11 is Moving the Mark , a new programme pairing prominent visual artists and dancers towards a series of responsive, interdisciplinary experiments in movement and mark-making. Artists and dancers include William Kentridge, Vincent Mantsoe, Penny Siopis, Shannel Winlock-Pailman, Mary Sibande, Nandipha Mntambo, Kitty Phetla, and more. Micca Manganye creates sound effects for the Visual Radio Plays Here, the interest is in what might be discovered as a result of pairing movers and mark-makers, but also what’s revealed in the act of collaboration – what new methodologies or creative decisions emerge when a dancer must mimic an ink stain, or a painter must choreograph their brushstrokes? Penny Siopis will be one of the artists in Moving the Mark, a programme of visual artists and dancers in collaboration. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi CONTINUED COLLATIONS Season 11 features both newly incubated, interdisciplinary work, and continued explorations of compelling works from the first three Collations series, namely – Visual Radio Plays , Sounding Picture s , and The Unexpected City . Collectively interrogating a dramaturgy of sound, moving image, and the stories of the city, these programmes are spread across the Season and will each feature for one night only. Again, it is the uniquely generative ways of working that came out of these experiments in their first iterations that The Centre is interested in carrying forward in Season 11, with Sounding Pictures also featuring a host of new films by directors and filmmakers, including Dutch director and filmmaker Frank Scheffer, Beninese musician Angelo Moutsapha, and William Kentridge. The Unexpected City sees the evolution of its sketch theatre performances, written by MoMo Matsunyane, Jefferson Tshabalala, Melusi Mnqobi Molefe, and Balindile ka Ngcobo, while Visual Radio Plays sees the return of musicians including Shane Cooper, Micca Manganye, Daniel Stompie Selibe, Reggie Teys, Pertunia Msani, and Candice Moleshe. Season 11 features a series of performances and public light installations in and around Fox Street and Arts on Main, curated by Marcus Neustetter. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi. SITE-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCES &amp; INSTALLATIONS Downtown Johannesburg remains a vital site and source of inspiration, informing how works are situated both inside and outside of The Centre. An ongoing component of the Season is Site, Light, Action | Fox Street Activations, a series of performances and public light activations in and around Fox Street and Arts on Main, curated by Vienna-based South African artist Marcus Neustetter. Much of Neustetter’s thinking revolves around what lies inside and outside the buildings that surround us in Downtown Joburg, as well as the personal narratives and questions carried by those who move through and inhabit these environments. Site, Light, Action emerges from these explorations. “These small experimental moments embrace the unknown, seeking connections and stories that might reveal themselves through artistic languages. Framed by temporary sets and focused by mobile light, these moments function as small public studios of attempted sense-making,” says Neustetter. The Unexpected City is a programme of sketch theatre performances inspired by the stories and characters of the city. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi. Regular Centre collaborators will feature in Site, Light, Action including the musicians Jill Richards, Shane Cooper, Reggie Teys, and Candice Moleshe, who will perform pop-up, coffee-shop performances. Sello Pesa and Phala Ookeditse Phala will present Ngoana oa Noka ea Kubetu , a new iteration of their Nokeng ya Kubetu series, which explores water as both a resource and a life necessity. Neustetter, in collaboration with Zivanai Matangi will also be presenting a new series of light drawings which will be on exhibition during the Season. Site, Light, Action activations take place from 26 to 29 November and are free to the public. THREE NEW PLAYS FROM THE SO ACADEMY S O | From Script to Stage, is a programme of three newly incubated works of theatre from the interrelated series of mentorship programmes – Thinking In Writing , Thinking In Directing , Thinking In Lighting , and Thinking In Staging – curated by Athena Mazarakis and SO | The Academy for the Less Good Idea. These first iterations take the form of 20-minute performances, shown back-to-back in a single programme. The three featured plays are The Braai Republic , written by Mongezi Ntukwana and directed by Noluthando Jupiter Sibisi; Chosi Three Times, written by Uvile Ximba and directed by Chris Djuma; and Exodus With No Last Name , written by Nolwazi Mahlangu and directed by Aalliyah Matintela. Lighting design for the plays will be by Joël Leonard. These new works have come out of an intensive mentorship format where young theatre makers receive guidance from leading South African theatre makers. Sounding Pictures sees a group of musicians and performers creating a live, responsive score to a series of short films. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi “So, here we have play texts mentored by incredible writers like MoMo Matsunyane, Neil Coppen and Jefferson Tshabalala, and directorial approaches inspired by brilliant practicing directors like Monageng Vice Motshabi, Mwenya Kabwe, and Qondiswa James. It also gives a novice lighting designer the opportunity to apply the learning from internationally acclaimed lighting designer Urs Schönebaum,” says Mazarakis. “In these plays, we see writers dealing with key concerns in South Africa today, telling stories about migration, capitalism, and disconnection in the digital age.” GUEST PERFORMANCES, TALKS &amp; ACTIVATIONS A number of invited works will form part of Season 11, by local and international artists alike, including Indian artist and activist Mallika Taneja (India) and journalist and author Dele Olojede (Nigeria), who will both feature in separate In Conversation programmes. Olojede will enter into a sonic call-and-response with vinyl selector, Nombuso Mathibela, around the theme of Money Miss Road, a Nigerian phrase that means money is wasted, thrown away, or spent on frivolous things. Taneja will be in dialogue with Nomsa Mazwai about the act of challenging fear, patriarchy, and the limitations imposed on women’s freedom of movement in public spaces. As a solo work, Taneja brings Be Careful to Season 11, a satirical piece that challenges the notion of safety as it’s prescribed and practiced in women’s lives. Shanell Winlock-Pailman will present Oh, death. Where is your sting! as a guest performance for Season 11. Photographer - Zivanai Matangi While she is visiting Johannesburg, Taneja and the women members of the Maboneng Community Policing Forum will hold a series of conversations towards hosting a Johannesburg iteration of Women Walk at Midnight , an initiative that invites women volunteers to join a nighttime walk along a predetermined route in Johannesburg, as a gesture of reclaiming their right to inhabit the city. Keep an eye on Women Walk At Midnight’s social media for further details. Internationally renowned dancers and choreographers Vincent Mantsoe and Shanell Winlock-Pailman will each present a guest work as part of a special double bill. Mantsoe’s Desert Poem encapsulates the allure and tranquillity of an environment characterised by extremes, while Winlock-Pailman’s Oh, death! Where is your sting? , conceptualised and developed at The Centre, is a work about death, grief, and the moments in between. Season 11 will also see The Centre continue its collaboration with cultural collective, NarowBi, who will activate the Arts on Main courtyard with Party + Market , a curated experience featuring stalls and artists showcasing music, art, style and more over the weekend.

      <title>A NEW ERA OF DIGITAL ART DEALING</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/a-new-era-of-digital-art-dealing</link>
      <description>A NEW ERA OF DIGITAL ART DEALING - By Mary Corrigall Tony Gum, Xhosa Woman, Intombi I, R79,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY ------------------ The analogue art world faces mounting challenges – from rising rental costs for gallery and studio spaces to depreciating local currencies, which make participation in international art fairs increasingly expensive for South African art dealers. While digital solutions cannot entirely resolve these issues, the shift that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic looks less like a detour and more like a template for diversifying audience reach during economic downturns. Digital technology had already woven its way into the art market before Covid-19, via third-party platforms such as Artsy and Instagram that connected collectors, artists, and dealers across borders. Yet many art professionals resisted adopting technology. This was rooted in the belief that making and experiencing art should happen primarily in person. However, art-market theorists Beatrix E. M. Habelsberger and Pawan V. Bhansing propose (in their 2021 article, Art Galleries in Transformation: Is COVID-19 Driving Digitisation?) that dealers also feared “losing their power in the valuation process of art and their role in the art market due to the democratic nature of the Internet.” They also were concerned with the impact of eroding the personal interaction and engagement, which has been a fundamental part of art dealing, and how this would reduce art to a commodity like any other. Chloë Shain, Phone language (haptic input) I, R15,000.00 ex. VAT, ENQUIRE In the African art market, the digital turn proved especially beneficial. According to Corrigall &amp; Co.’s study of art ecosystems in Africa’s most active art capitals (2019–2024), the migration of art fairs and events online during Covid-19 enabled a new generation of dealers in Nigeria, South Africa, and Morocco to establish themselves and build clients “without being burdened with the heavy overheads that bricks-and-mortar galleries would entail. The relaxing of criteria to participate in art fairs during this period enabled this to occur.” In short, the digital shift propelled entrepreneurship across the visual arts — from artists leveraging social media to market their work and connect directly with curators and buyers, to a new younger generation of dealers and curators staging pop-up exhibitions, to hybrid entities such as Latitudes Online becoming integral to the South African art market. The Latitudes Online platform has grown in recent years due to its annual live event, the RMB Latitudes Art Fair and provides a good example of how digital and live interactions need to be combined to support artists and dealers. RMB Latitudes Art Fair, 2024, photo by Anthea Pokroy Global art-market reports, which are dominated by data from the US, Europe, and China, confirm that in-person exhibitions and fairs remain essential, however, they do show that online interfaces continue to matter and are being integrated with analogue activities. Websites Trump Social Media Online sales account for roughly 22% of dealer revenue, yet gallery websites remain a more effective sales channel than social media, according to The Art Market 2025: An Art Basel &amp; UBS Report . “The share of online sales to new buyers increased to 46%, from 35% in 2023,” the report notes. This shift aligns with The Artsy Art Market Trends 2025 report, which found that 43% of surveyed galleries plan to focus more on online sales. Buying art online — once foreign to many collectors — has become normalised; nearly 60% of Artsy’s surveyed collectors reported purchasing art online. While Artsy’s position as a third-party platform may skew toward online activity, South African dealers at all levels appear to be using their websites as active sales portals. Even when they lack full e-commerce checkouts, most gallery sites allow close, in-scale viewing and provide catalogue-style details, and some even include an “enquire” button for swift contact. Has this led to more sales? The clearest benefit is expanded international reach. Ethel Aanyu, AIBELOKINI, R1,800.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY “Since COVID, digital marketing has shifted the parameters and gave collectors and galleries permission to do things remotely... we deal with a lot of international [clients] and people aren’t able to come to the gallery and see the shows or the artwork in person, and we do sell a lot of work through digital media,” says Emma Van der Merwe, director at Everard Read Gallery Cape Town. According to the Artsy 2025 report, galleries are strengthening digital marketing amid a softer market: 70% cite economic uncertainty as their primary challenge, followed by “changing collector behaviour or lack of demand” (60%). Instagram typically generates interest and enquiries rather than direct sales. “I have an active Instagram account that I constantly update, and it’s quite dynamic in creating interest in work and marketing my exhibitions but it’s not used for sales purposes,” says the renowned painter Kate Gottgens. Some independent artists do rely on Instagram for sales. Textile artist Turiya Magadlela, who remains independent, does not have a website and uses her Instagram account to connect with potential buyers. Mid-career artist Karin Preller also leverages social media for sales, though she recently participated in RMB Latitudes Art Fair to diversify her sales channels. Turiya Magadlela, Tembeka Akukhontombi engiyithandayo II, R1,800.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY The Digital Divide Building compelling gallery websites requires more than a static catalogue: audiences expect substantive reading material (downloadable PDFs) and video content – often artists speaking about their work. Only the first-tier South African galleries (Goodman and Stevenson) routinely produce such assets because of the cost but perhaps also due to their focus on international collectors. Resources, skills, and digital fluency are prerequisites for comprehensive online strategies, and few galleries can afford a dedicated, qualified digital team. This aligns with the Art Basel &amp; UBS report finding that larger galleries make a higher proportion of online sales than smaller ones. Strauss &amp; Co, South Africa’s largest auction house, provides a good example of how technology can sustain sales in slower cycles. A comparison of 2019 and 2024 activity indicates the pandemic catalysed online growth: five online auctions in 2019 expanded to 22 by 2024, driving online revenue up by more than 200% and lifting average sell-through rates by about 10%. Despite this growth, online revenue still trails live auctions (which also include online bidding), largely because higher-value works are typically consigned to live sales, while lower-priced or more niche items are directed online. Online Auctions Cater to Niche Interests The online format has enabled Strauss &amp; Co to stage niche sales - ceramics, single-artist focuses, and region-specific auctions (e.g., art produced in KwaZulu-Natal). These sales might be small and bring in substantially less revenue than live ones, but collectively they bolster results amid softer live-auction revenue. An analysis of 2019 vs 2024 indicates live-auction revenue declined by about 12% despite more lots offered. In effect, frequent, lower-cost online sales featuring more accessibly priced works have helped offset a market downturn. “We are very proudly a technology-driven auction house, and our technology department plays a crucial role in keeping us ahead of the curve. We closely analyse audience behaviour, sales trends, and the effectiveness of our marketing strategies... It is not just about embracing digital tools but using them intelligently,” says Strauss &amp; Co director Bina Genovese. Importantly, despite increased development in online portals, in-person events, interactions and relationships remain vital. Viewing art at auction previews, art fairs or exhibition opening nights with a glass of bubbles in hand among like-minded people keeps this industry turning.

      <title>On behalf of… Journals: Curating around absence</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/on-behalf-of-journals-curating-around-absence</link>
      <description>ON BEHALF OF... JOUNRALS: CURATING AROUND ABSENCE - by Denzo Nyathi Aksah Seyoum, Rites of Flesh V, 2025, R19,002.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY ---------- One day, it might be studied by evolutionary biologists or neurologists how the art world, over time, rendered the fusiform gyrus partially obsolete. This strangely named part of the brain is responsible for some of our higher function visual processing, including (but not limited to) the recognition of faces. In the art world, the need to be able to recognise and process a face as actually potentially belonging to some specific human being is a skill in poor demand. This phenomenon is in some ways quite unique to our subsect of visual culture. True cinephiles carry their ability to quickly recognise an actor and their broader filmography as a badge of honour. In the visual arts, the muse of an artwork might be appreciated for their beauty, but is seldom the subject of further inquiry. This of course isn’t wholly unique to the arts; in the broader scheme of our visual and media culture, and especially at the rate at which media can be (even unwillingly) consumed today, it is a necessary evil to abandon any desire to fully place every stranger’s face we see on a billboard or a viral clip that is both present before us and fading into digital obscurity. We see strangers’ faces everywhere. This thought faintly haunted me when my co-curator (Boitumelo Makousu) and I were so beautifully confronted by an assembly of our own creation as we grappled with the sheer amount of portraiture in On behalf of… . Indeed, we thought and said aloud: we have never seen quite so many faces. This was but an emergent quality of the exhibition itself, seemingly taking on a life (and many facades) of its own. With nothing but sheer respect for the amazing team of Zeitz MOCAA who brought together the landmark When We See Us exhibition, under the curatorial leadership of the late, great Koyo Kouoh, my mind wonders to what it means to have seen so many of these faces in 100 years of Black portraiture. In our exhibition making, we understand that these artists may go on to do such great things through these portraits. In the same breath, we acknowledge that their subjects will hardly come to amass a modicum of that celebrity. One might argue: why should they? Abel Bedilu Spectator (ነፃሪ) II, 2025 R 7,967.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY My case is not to be the champion of the muse, ensuring that every figure painted is known as far and widely as the Mona Lisa, who might in some spaces be regarded as bigger than her renderer. Rather, my curiosity is in our relationship to representation, and what else goes unseen/unknown. A quick skim on Stuart Hall and the field of semiotics quickly helps us recognise that what we might see on gallery walls is the representation of a person, and not the person themself. It is but one beauty of art to transform a single instance into something other than its bare truth; something more exciting in its deviations from that truth. For all of the simplicity of the previous statement, art and representation’s relationship is infinitely more tenuous and complicated than that. Historically, in the fine art space, some people and stories have long been represented in good faith to varying degrees of fidelity. So much so that the representation can safely be bastardised, playful, and maybe even absurd. Natasha Evans, Pit Of My Stomach, R 63,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Yet, for other groups, representation exists in such dire scarcity. As such, every single gesture need be measured. And measured again. Then once more, of course, for good measure. This was the thought process in On behalf of… as we considered an exhibition which worked as rhetoric, speaking back to the powers that be at the time of the G20 summit in Johannesburg. How does the most important international forum for the discussion of economic co-operation take place without so many African voices? So much so that South Africa belongs to one of the two G20 nation groups which are not organised around regional proximity. We’d be remiss to think of the absenteeism of African leadership as incidental; Dr Phokeng Setai warns that “History has proven to us on so many occasions that the violence enacted towards marginalised cultures is a systematic consequence of white supremacy rather than merely a symptom of intermittent shifts in global patterns” (2020: 40 - 41). Blen Deresse, Unrest II, 2025, R8,769.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Setai’s words are taken from his paper Curating in the dark , which outlines a curatorial methodology that seeks to open up the pathways in which to engage with Black artistic production beyond the art market’s expectations and desires of ‘Black art’. This method primarily engages with performative, durational work as it prioritises process over an object-centric approach. Where On behalf of… brings together works that are in stark contrast, curating in the dark’s interest in “incorporating strategies of multivocality and dialogism” (43) is key to the exhibition’s concerns. The exhibition’s first point of call was to decentre the artistic production of South African artists. This was not for any shortcoming of South Africa’s arts, but in recognising that should South Africa operate in any kind of pan-African solidarity on the G20 stage, it is placed in the impossible position of representing a very diverse people of 54 nations with their own distinct problems. In contrast, in engaging with the artistic practices of 27 artists situated across the continent, the exhibition prioritises subjectivity and, as with curating in the dark, multivocality. As a distinction, perhaps our method of curating around absence begins with asking: who is not represented? This line of enquiry only opens the door to further scrutiny. If some of the most powerful states in the world have failed to stage a more diverse forum, and this exhibition seeks to challenge that, it might be pointed out how we were able to only bring together artists from 12 different countries. To this, I respond: yes, let us demand more. Curating around absence operates like an excavation: the further we critique and dig into the holes, the more we are able to welcome into our spheres of knowledge. The contours of this exhibition are defined not around its content, but from the negative space it moves through. These are the haunted halls between us and those African countries that were too hard to reach, inaccessible by the thousands of kilometres worth of tripwire that makes intracontinental artistic exchange a difficult, bureaucratic and extremely costly endeavour. Carine Mansan, Meditation, from the series Le jardin de ma mère, 2025, R35,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY Those artists and artworks that we do manage to bring across are asked not to bring with them some objective political report of the country. The works reflect personal, intimate histories and enquiries. These works are by no means a comprehensive survey of the African political landscape (if such an easily packaged thing even were to exist). This subjectivity calls upon us to invite more voices, who might speak to more traditionally political subjects. Intentionally, we wanted to invite works which are both lively and jovial, as well as works which are jaded and are literally (as in literally literally ) enwrapped in barbed wire. To reflect only the latter would be to do a disservice to the joy that comes with living in this beautiful continent, in spite of all the challenges posed. This subjectivity digs holes in the fallacy of objectivity. Even in something as supposedly objective as the cold hard facts of economic policy, there are real people’s small and big problems tangentially related. Just as there are real people with small and big problems depicted through the many many faces in the gallery. Through this lens, and in curating around absence, we look forward to seeing more faces engaging in these discussions, and asking those most pressing questions on behalf of those unrepresented, unknown faces. 29 Oct 2025 .m-article__header, .m-article__feature-image { display: none !important; }</description>

      <description>THE LATITUDES PODCAST FEATURING ANTWAUN SARGENT ----------- Powered by: iTOO Artinsure Supported by: BASA Co-curated by: Art School Africa Hosted by: Refiloe Mpakanyane &quot; I made an oath to support and critically engage Black artists, and I’ve done that every day for 15 years. - Antwaun Sargent What does it mean to be an art critic today, in a world where attention is shrinking and art is increasingly filtered through the scroll? Writer and curator Antwaun Sargent has spent the past 15 years championing and critically engaging Black artists, producing vital writing that has reshaped how contemporary art is understood and valued. In conversation with Refiloe Mpakanyane, Sargent speaks candidly about the expansion of the critic’s role, the rise of new cultural voices outside institutions, the power and problem of visibility, and why the work of sustaining artistic ecosystems goes far beyond the market. In this episode, we discuss: How the role of the art critic has expanded beyond traditional media The impact of social platforms on the way we experience and talk about art The rise of new, trusted cultural voices outside institutional networks Why visibility matters for artistic recognition and critical engagement The evolution of Black representation in galleries and museums globally The difference between s elling art and sustaining artistic practice What it means to build ecosystems, not just audiences How collectors, curators and writers shape cultural legacy &quot; Art is an analogue challenge. You can’t understand a work in 30 seconds, you have to really look. - Antwaun Sargent Chapter 3 of the Latitudes Podcast explores Art Criticism in the Age of the Algorithm This chapter brings together writers, critics, and art professionals to examine the evolving landscape of contemporary art criticism and its new means of communication. Art writers have long played a pivotal role in steering conversations within the art world, but as their platforms and methods of communication shift, so too does the depth and scope of their influence.

      <description>WHEN WE MISTAKE THE MAP FOR THE TERRITORY... Provocations from the immersive studio of Marcus Neustetter Marcus Neustetter, live drawing and building projection at RMB Latitudes 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy To mark the opening of the RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, Marcus Neustetter—supported by the Austrian Cultural Forum Pretoria—presented a live drawing and building projection. Rooted in his long-standing preoccupation with maps and the lines that divide and occupy territories, the work responds to today’s metacrisis with a provocative question: Are we following pre-drawn maps so rigidly that we no longer perceive what is truly happening in the territory itself? Accompanied by recorded voices and sounds from Anathi Conjwa, Micca Manganye, and Xolisile Bongwana—collected during previous studio experiments—Neustetter treated the evening as a durational open studio. In this immersive environment, he redrew and reconfigured lines of light live, responding intuitively to the sounds, the site, its context, and its architecture. Under the same title, Neustetter also joined a panel discussion on the final day of the fair, reflecting on his experiences within both the South African and Austrian art ecosystems. As an artist engaged in both contexts, he drew comparisons, highlighted contrasts, and challenged participants to rethink their approaches to art-making within the shifting global and cultural climate—again questioning the ill-defined “map” of the contemporary art industry. This feature introduces some of Neustetter’s artistic methodologies and presents a snapshot of the journey leading to this work. The live act of drawing and mapping as a form of exploration has remained a central tool throughout his career. In the catalogue text for Defining Lines , his 2015 solo exhibition at Gallery AOP, Wilhelm van Rensburg writes: &quot; Lines define much more than cartographic representations of territorial boundaries, Marcus Neustetter seems to be suggesting this with his drawings and performances. Image on left: Tunisia, Afghanistan, Italy,Rwanda, Nigeria,Thailand, Algeria, Iraq, Mali, Greece, India, Kenya, Burma, Somalia, Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Bangladesh, France, Peru, Egypt, Ecuador, Russian Federation, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mauritania, Chad, Libya, Colombia, Angola, Yemen, China, Senegal, Mexico, Kazakhstan, Central African Republic, Northern Ireland, Nepal, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Israel, Philippines, Iran, Ukraine, Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia – fractured , 2014, ink on canvas, 1800x1600mm Image on right: Marcus Neustetter, live drawing and building projection at RMB Latitudes 2025, photo by Chelsea Selvan &quot; They are both noun (naming) and verb (making): they define space as much as they are definitions of space. The lines expound conflicts and conquests, and they are simultaneously definitions of global, political and economic strife. In his drawing performances, Neustetter attempts to imbue the mark with the kind of real-world impact that a line on a territorial map has. Abstracting and isolating the line is as much about escaping the realities of borders and zones of conflict, as it is about contemplating the line itself and the spaces it creates. Neustetter, however, pushes beyond the confines of borders, looking for a creative impulse that might be sparked when two lines run uncomfortably close to each other—giving rise to a series of graphic explosions in the in-between spaces where definition and defining appear to be equally nebulous endeavours.” Acts in Russian Green (4BO) Model Paint, 2022 Ink on cotton paper ea. 150 x 210mm In the context of today’s crises—war, environmental collapse, and socio-political upheaval—some of Neustetter’s earlier works have taken on renewed relevance. Their visual language now mirrors the aggression and urgency of the current moment. Their symbolism and content are re-emerging in new artworks and modes of mark-making. Simultaneously, his practice has evolved—deepening its relationship with lived experience. More than ever, Neustetter invites dialogue with collaborators across disciplines. His work seeks new hybrid expressions to open pathways for audience engagement, perspective-shifting, and impact. A core strategy involves merging digital projection techniques with analogue methods, exploring the messiness of media interaction on both conventional and unconventional surfaces. Some of the projected images originate from a range of artistic research materials: demilitarised zones, fragmented earth observation sketches, and disjointed historical and colonial reconfigurations of territory. These works balance the aesthetic of the line with the politics of its application. By acknowledging that a map is neither a direct reflection of reality nor a true representation of territory, Neustetter challenges our assumptions and proposes that lived experience—rather than abstraction—offers deeper insight. As a result, the final works take many forms: temporary projections, permanent large-scale installations, and even a small drawing aboard the International Space Station. window.sliderConfig1762498065523 = function() { var numberSlides = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.bggle--slider[section-id=&apos;1762498065523&apos;] .image-slider&quot;); if (numberSlides.length &gt; 0) { window.slider1762498065523 = tns({ container: &apos;.bggle--slider[section-id=&quot;1762498065523&quot;]&apos;, items: 1, slideBy: &apos;page&apos;, autoplay: true, gutter: 10, navAsThumbnails: false, navPosition: &quot;bottom&quot;, arrowKeys: true, autoHeight:true, autoplayButton: false, autoplayButtonOutput: false, mouseDrag: true, autoplay: true, responsive: { 768: { items: 1 }, 1025: { items: 1 } } }); } }; document.addEventListener(&apos;init-slider-1762498065523&apos;, window.sliderConfig1762498065523) Somewhere over Africa, reworked Sumbandila Satellite images, digital print on fabriano paper, 500x500mm each Lead the way again, engraving and microscopic map drawing on acrylic, 2022, 10x10x10mm, on board the International Space Station with The Moon Gallery. Neustetter’s practice, however, extends beyond the visual. Through deep collaborations with artists, philosophers, and scientists, he opens his studio as a generative and immersive space. This isn’t new to him. Over the years, he’s cultivated socially engaged work with Stephen Hobbs as The Trinity Session (thetrinitysession.com) and in his individual projects such as Imaginary Futures (imaginaryfutures.org) , The ZoNE (the-zone.at) , and Space Shelter Earth (space-shelter.earth) . A recent example of this interdisciplinary process unfolded at the Centre for the Less Good Idea. Neustetter facilitated a two-part collaboration with artists Anathi Conjwa, Micca Manganye, and Thulisile Binda. His only instruction: to have a conversation, in any form, and map it. Through voice and percussion, their exchange gave rise to a collaborative drawing on a large paper surface. The resulting work became a poetic expression of loss, fear, uncertainty, resilience, and hope—a collective territory made tangible. This map, together with the recorded sounds, later formed the basis for a live projection at the Bioscope Independent Cinema and again at the Latitudes Art Fair. Neustetter has increasingly tested this methodology not just in art but as a framework for building new networks and approaches. In 2023, at the signing of a cultural agreement between South Africa and Austria—represented by H.E. Mr. Zizi Kodwa and H.E. Mr. Alexander Schallenberg—Neustetter, along with Manganye and Bongwana, created a live, collective map. The map was later deconstructed and distributed to all attendees. Each piece became part of a virtual network, serving as both a symbolic and material provocation for the Austrian Cultural Forum’s ongoing presence in South Africa. The gesture invited reflection on perspective, engagement, and mutual recognition in shaping cultural exchange. Lost and Found, 2025, mixed media drawing on paper, 3x3m Both ministers recognized the project as a powerful metaphor for the role of art in fostering empathy, dialogue, and new approaches in political and personal spheres. Born in South Africa to Austrian parents, Neustetter has long explored the meaning of identity through physical and conceptual border-crossing. Since relocating from Johannesburg to Austria five years ago, his immersive studio practice has brought together collaborators from across Europe and Africa to collectively respond to contemporary crises and imagine alternative futures. Now, in 2025, Neustetter has reunited with Manganye in Vienna. Together, they co-create a new experimental map and soundscape—combining tools and materials sourced from both South Africa and Austria. Their collaboration unfolds in call and response: drawn lines meet percussion, the visual informs the aural, and vice versa. Neustetter composes an abstract cartography of territories and migration, while Manganye concludes the session with an improvised rendition of Thula Mama. Thula Mama —meaning “Be quiet, Mama” or “Hush, Mama”—is a lullaby that became a powerful political statement during South Africa’s anti-apartheid movement. Originally a song of comfort, it grew into a symbol of resistance and grief, honouring mothers whose sons were taken to the mines or lost to the struggle. Today, it remains a poignant reminder of music’s power to inspire change and offer solace in times of crisis. The song’s quiet call to witness—its urging to attend to the things we remain silent about—echoes through Neustetter’s responsive drawing. Together, the music and visual language invite us to reconsider the symbolic maps we’ve inherited. As a final gesture, the artists offered fragments of this new map to members of the Austrian Presidential and Cultural Delegation visiting South Africa—extending not only the abstract network of the map, but also a tangible invitation to collaborate, reflect, and engage. Imagine Moments, 2023, Austrian Cultural Forum, Pretoria Through this evolving body of work, Marcus Neustetter continues to affirm the value of art as a space for critical reflection, cross-disciplinary exchange, and collective imagination—his studio remaining a site of immersive process, where participation, experimentation, and dialogue are central to shaping new ways of seeing and understanding the world. 25 Jun 2025 .m-article__header, .m-article__feature-image { display: none !important; }</description>

      <title>Aku Ndhl’ela Engayi Ekhaya – Phumelele Kunene</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/aku-ndhl-ela-engayi-ekhaya-phumelele-kunene</link>
      <description>&quot;Aku &apos;ndhlela engayi ekhaya&quot; Meaning: There is no road which does not lead home ______ Photography in this exhibition operates as a language that speaks to both memory-keeping and future-imagining. Memory represents the past and history, while the future embodies the promise of freedom. Memory, inseparable from freedom, is not mere nostalgia; it becomes a strategy for survival and transformation. Amartya Sen, an economist and philosopher, argues that freedom is not just about rights, but about real opportunities and capabilities to live the life one values. Similarly, Max Weber’s concept of life chances reminds us that our opportunities and even our sense of possibility are deeply shaped by the conditions we inherit: our homes, our histories, and the social structures that frame our lives. This exhibition explores fragments of home, the spaces and conditions that shape us, through the intertwined themes of memory, freedom, and identity. Home here is not confined to walls; it is emotional, mental, and spiritual. It is a place that shapes and mirrors who we are, even when fractured by inequality and displacement. The participating artists engage with elements of home, mapping its complexities through personal narratives, cultural inheritances, and contested histories. Their works confront the contradictions of belonging and marginalisation while affirming resilience, creativity, and cultural survival. Here, photography becomes an act of resistance and imagination, turning historical weight into raw material for new possibilities. What was once meant to diminish becomes, through these images, a source of strength and beauty. Photography here is alchemized, not as a fixed image, but as a process. These works move beyond the point-and-shoot gesture, treating the photograph as material to be transformed. Through layering, experimentation, and hybrid techniques, each piece becomes a living object, assembled, altered, and reimagined—reflecting the complexity of memory and the multiplicity of identity. This exhibition unfolds as a living archive, a site of witnessing and questioning. It invites viewers to slow down, reflect, and see photography as both evidence and imagination, a bridge between the real and the remembered. It challenges dominant narratives and positions people not as passive subjects of history but as active agents shaping its future. Photography here is not only a record—it is an act of claiming space, of declaring: This is who we are, and this is the life we value. ______ Banner Artwork Details: Simphiwe Fuwe Molefe, Ditsojane tsa ha Moloi, 2023, 42 x 59.4 cm, Photographic print on Ilford Textured Silk paper, R16 250 ex.

Together, these practices create an ecosystem of stories: Tshepiso’s exploration of systemic memory resonates with Hoek’s transformations of the photographic surface, while Fuwe’s collaged celebrations of cultural intersections introduce a counterpoint of unity and belonging. Across these intersections, the exhibition constructs a collective language of resistance, imagination, and renewal. Together, these works create a space where inherited constraints collide with imagined freedoms. They share a common urgency: to disrupt forgetting, to reframe identity, and to insist on liberation through the act of remembrance.

      <title>Embo: Where We Once Knew – Onke Ngcuka</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/embo-where-we-once-knew-onke-ngcuka</link>
      <description>embo: where we once knew, 2025 ______ ‘embo: where we once knew‘ is a pathway to ancestral memory: isikhumbuzo sethu sothando (somhlaba). This exhibition is a love letter to the land; it is the cry and the consolation; it is a reminder that this land continues to birth us. Xa singena enkundleni yolwazi lomhlaba, we recall that isiXhosa cosmology also remembers abantu as extensions of the land. A land that remembers us - according to ancestral memory - as a culmination of culture, tradition and knowledge attuned to the rhythms of nature. We dance, to melodies of the water and cow hides. Perhaps this is why when we discuss our conception kuthwe siphum’emlanjeni nenkomo. Unobangela bobukho bethu is through the generosity of the natural world’s extension and sacrifice of itself for us, kuba umntu ngumntu ngendalo. isiXhosa has long acknowledged this symbiotic relationship between planetary systems and its people: the origins of clan names named after flora and fauna centre this truth lovingly, begrudgingly. We are forever etched into this earth. It remembers us vividly. Xhosa cosmology cites UHlanga as the Holy Ancestral Place theorised to exist at the intersection of the sea and horizon. Watching ukwehla kwelanga along the coastlines of eKapa, it is near impossible to imagine a Holier place. But the multigenerational collective of Hamburg, eMpumaKoloni have brazenly and beautifully begun to reinsert us into the Holy Narrative - weaving our worlds into “Our Sacred Ocean: Ulwandle Lwethu Olungcwele, 2021 - 2022”. Our future is promised by our past. Our futures remain uncertain because we have forgotten our past promise to the land when we landed on its shores. A starting point to answering this question is offered in Abongile Sidzumo’s, “Yakhal’inkomo”, which continues Ngozi’s caressing sonic, Serote’s powerful prose and Mam’Khumalo’s lustrous melody of the same name, cry, longing, mourning. Sidzumo’s craft here, gently shapes the luscious crevices of imihlaba nentaba zakwaXhosa that remind me of the Amathole Mountains that cradle amaMpandla, oTshayingwe, oMbona, in my ancestral home eXesi. Sidzumo’s offering reminds us to mourn the forgotten promises to the land, and its bygone biodiversity. Here, we grieve what once was before we build anew. Yonela Makoba cradles the land (and us) as we mourn our once celebrated love for it. ‘Thula Thula ( Hush Hush), 2021’ is a lullaby to the Amathole mountains; iintaba zemazi which lay the ground of the fertile land that birthed Hintsa, Biko neKumkanikazi Sandile - iintaba ezisathulisa amathambo abo nangomso. Our futures are buried here. Our past must be reintroduced. Cheriese Dilrajh’s “What the Seas Brought, 2024” is a beautiful marrying of culture and the sea; a beautiful tapestry of the intricate connections between people and planet. This piece drives this exhibition home. Dilrajh’s ode to lost ancestral connection to land as a result of displacement, violence, disruption, is perfectly placed to leave us with the question of, ‘now that we remember, where do we go from here?’. This tapestry weaves - a layer at a time - the ponderances of creating new meaning from unknown histories that continue to shape ubuntu bethu. We must converse, especially so during the time of deadly climate devastation - née, nature’s retaliation to our exploitation of it - that disrupts culture, livelihoods and forces migration. We remember those who live(d) along floodlines and have now lost bloodlines. ‘embo: where we once knew’ is a reminder that we are here but briefly (gorgeously), that we must move like the dawn of evening light; softly, delicately, knowing we are rapidly departing and only the land will truly remember us: Us, the sweet hushed kiss of a gentle breeze upon ulusu Thina, abazalwe ziintaba zemfazwe that hold an arresting, devastating beauty Thina, bantwana bemifula ‘nto zoHlanga abancanyeswi lilanga, E xa lisijongile lithi, “Kwakuhle ukuzibona uphila phakathi kolusu lomnye!” Sicelela thina, sicelela umhlaba in remembering Ms Simphiwe Dana’s Mayine (2010) as she melodies, “MAYINE! Galelela ntsikelelo Oh! Yan’inkululelo” Sithi Masibuyeleni Embo! All imagining is welcome.

Onke gently carries the manifestation of this era; a time of bloom, the golden era of hope, when victory was ripe in the air. Ngcuka’s work centres inkululeko through the lens of uthando lomhlaba: love, as understood through Xhosa indigenous wisdom. Her work is an endless open love letter to the land and its people. The creative director works in the film and art sectors, recently having produced a short film on climate and spirituality using intsomi storytelling form. Their current art exhibition ‘embo where we once knew’, currently with Latitudes Online, is an extension of her exploration of nature-native relations. Ngcuka believes umntu ngumntu ngendalo. She knows that the remembering of this symbiotic love and relation is a means yokuzilanda, yokuzithanda. Xa yena ezilanda, the artist gives gratitudes to the landscapes of eKhayelitsha, eXesi, eMakhanda naseRhawutini, ngokumakha. eKapa, her birthplace and parental home, always holding the centre. OTshayingwe, AmaMpandla, oMbona, cradling her through. She honed her craft at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), Johannesburg, while studying towards an undergraduate degree in Political Science, International Relations and Psychology. She further went on to study towards an honours degree in Journalism and Media Studies at the edgy institution. Her five/year stint in journalism saw her scribing at leading organisations such as Reuters (news and TV), Daily Maverick’s environmental unit Our Burning Planet and Investigative centre AmaBhungane. Here, she nurtured nature&apos;s narratives and shunned lacklustre leaders - locally and internationally, from Soweto to Scotland.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/fabrics-tell-stories-too</link>
      <description>FABRICS TELLS STORIES TOO by Zandile Makroti Fabrics Tell Stories Too is born from a refusal to remain within the frame. It asks: what happens when art is no longer only what hangs on the wall, but also what is worn, carried, cleansed, bled, or mourned? What happens when materials themselves become testimonies of memory, resilience, and survival? The journey begins with Olivia Babel, whose handwoven sculptures centre on territory, identity, and cultural hybridity. Working with natural wool, golden fabrics, and cotton thread, she maps geography, memory, and the body through fibre. Each woven form becomes a landscape of remembrance, grounding the exhibition in connection and continuity. Quinton Mawila follows, transforming discarded bullhorns and Shangani bags into vessels of endurance. Through his reimagining of found materials, he explores how identity and resilience are bound together in acts of transformation. João Ladeira’s Beauty Makes You See Beyond the Lovely Sight deepens this reflection, unfolding as a meditation on memory, displacement, and transcendence. His wax fabric becomes a vessel of remembrance, honouring those lost to movement and silence. Through fabric, he insists on remembering, on keeping alive the stories of those who sought elsewhere. ______ Banner Artwork Details: Zandile Makroti, To be woman, 2023, Film/ Photography, 746 x 420x 35 mm, R10,000.00 ex. VAT Zandile Makroti, To be woman, 2023, Film/ Photography, 746 x 420 x 35 mm, R10 000 ex. VAT At the heart of the exhibition lies the body. In To Be a Woman , I explore menstruation as both burden and divinity. Through performance, film, and fabric, the work reflects on cycles marked by pain yet filled with sacredness. Cleansing follows. Turakella Editha Gyindo’s loofah sculptures speak of purification, preparing the self for both sacred and social space. Tumisang Khalipha’s reflections on water and grief echo this, where mourning finds release and movement becomes healing. From cleansing we move into acceptance. In Free Spirit Billie Zangewa honours a departed friend by imagining a body freed from earthly constraints, the work embodies both remembrance and the radical act of release. Ngollo Mlengeya’s Blemish reminds us that imperfection unites us. Beauty emerges through the cracks and marks that reveal the tenderness of being human. Yet protection is never far — Lungiswa Gqunta re-imagines razor wire in fabric as botanical resistance, where exclusion transforms into growth and memory reclaims lines of violence. Fabrics Tell Stories Too is not only an exhibition, it is a journey of rupture and repair, of softness and survival. It reminds us that stories live not only in paint, but in every fibre and object touched by life. Quinton Mawila, Kurhula, 2025, Photography, 42 cm (W) × 74.6 cm (H) × 3.5 cm (D), R10 000 ex.

Her practice moves across film photography, fine art materials, fabric and costume design, through which she explores feminism, ancestral memory, inner strength and female psychology. Through richly textured works that merge visual storytelling with spatial and costume-based narratives, Zandi examines human behaviour, particularly the emotional and psychological landscapes of women, through a deeply intuitive and empathetic lens. A qualified production designer and certified UX researcher, she draws on her background in film and design to craft experiences that are both conceptually grounded and emotionally immersive. Her curatorial approach considers not only the artwork but also how audiences move, feel and reflect within a space. Film remains a guiding influence across all her creative outputs, with each project unfolding as a layered narrative that bridges memory, materiality and identity.

      <description>In company of Humans presented by Kpingni Maureen Douabou _______ In her novel En compagnie des hommes, Ivorian writer Véronique Tadjo gives voice to the Baoba tree. The tree, symbol of great wisdom, speaks and awakens the memory of humanity, as a deadly and incurable virus looms and threatens the human race with extinction. In this way, Véronique Tadjo revives the African narrative tradition of giving voice to plants, animals, and other inanimate natural elements, which thus become privileged observers of the humans with whom they coexist. _______ Banner Artwork Details: Nuits Balneaires, Adaholin1, 2021, R54,601.00 ex.

She draws on her Ivorian heritage and the legacy of black feminist thinkers and artists from Africa and its diaspora to shed light on the past, give birth to alternative narratives, question culture and weave new dialogues. She understands eroticism and sensuality as spiritual power and a tool for healing, and she explores depiction of the body as a powerful site of resistance, remembrance, pleasure, and transformation. Kpingni-Maureen is a multi-faceted, self-taught cultural practitioner. She expands her visual narratives into interdisciplinary realms, weaving together stories of collective memory, recovery, and the importance of community. She has exhibited her work and participated in culural mediation programmes in the United States, France, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. She is a recipient of the 2025 Prince Claus Seed award.

VAT The exhibition In the Company of humans follows this tradition by exploring how natural resources shape realities and influence relations of exchange, domination, but also resistance. Fauna, flora, land and bodies of water become guardians of history as well as messengers of stories. In Fields of memory, the first chapter of the exhibition, Nerissa Brobbey and Rosalie Boka use painting to immortalize the natural environment maintained by those who came before us. With their photographic compositions, Adama Delphine Fawundu and Nuits Balnéaires offer another perspective on these landscapes. A perspective that merges environments with their inhabitants; environments marked by history as spaces for the exploitation of bodiesand materials. Like a fish chasing its own tail, these landscapes find themselves threatened today by climate change; a peril itself born a result of capitalist overexploitation. The idea of bodies and ecosystems merging appear with hedonistic sensuality in the digital collages of Kpingni Maureen Douabou, while Valerie Asiimwe Amani’s abstract textile artworks unfold like sensitive maps, woven from reminiscence. Nuits Balneaires, Adalahin 4, 2021, R54,601.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY . Through the eyes of these artists, natural elements become central to the transmission of memory: collective, familial, and personal. They are not just silent witnesses, they also become active participants in human history. This first chapter of the exhibition invites contemplation and admiration. A certain sense of romanticisation runs through the works, firther softened by a nostalgic veil. A feeling of loss also lingers; loss for something gone, yet somehow still present.

      <title>In the Between: States of Becoming</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/in-the-between-states-of-becoming</link>
      <description>In The Between: State of Becoming presented by Eyimofe Ideh ______ What happens in the space between certainty and the unknown? Between who we were and who we are becoming? In the Between: States of Becoming is a contemporary art exhibition exploring the psychological and emotional terrain of transition moments suspended between stability and chaos, clarity and confusion. The exhibition presents a raw and resonant look at the human condition through the lens of mental health, focusing on the invisible yet transformative process of change. Rooted in personal experiences, In the Between reflects both an inward journey and a shared human truth. It speaks to the fragile, often disorienting space we all encounter when the familiar begins to fall away and something undefined takes its place. These works do not merely depict mental health; they give form to the rawness of transition, the ambiguity of becoming, and the emotional weight of navigating the unknown. Roanna Tella’s meditations on joy and foreboding hold the fragile duality of becoming, where beauty and distress coexist in a single breath. Lawrence Meju’s vibrant collages transform fragments of urban rhythm into narratives of flux, mirroring the unpredictability of change. Stella Ekpe Samuel’s textured surfaces embody memory and womanhood as shifting thresholds, capturing the weight of identity in transition. Adeleke Femi’s expressionist figures reveal vulnerability and strength intertwined, charting the emotional terrain of memory and aspiration. Ololade Lawal’s abstractions of root and form trace the delicate balance between detachment and belonging. Together, these practices extend the exhibition’s meditation on liminality, offering resonant forms for the unseen shifts that define our becoming. Mental health is often treated as a destination a diagnosis, a state of wellness, a recovery. But In the Between posits mental health as a spectrum of becoming: a nonlinear and deeply human process. In a world increasingly shaped by unpredictability; politically, environmentally, and personally this exhibition offers space to grieve, to reflect, and to imagine who we are when everything we’ve known slips away. Ultimately, In the Between isn’t about resolution. It is about the courage to remain in flux. ______ Banner Artwork Details: Stella Ekpe Samuel, Lucid, 2024, oil and pastel on textured paper, 48 x 36 inches, CONTACT TO BUY.

      <title>Living Archives: Ancestral Currents Between Remembering, Resonance, and Renewal</title>

      <description>Living Archives: Ancestral Currents Between Remembering, Resonance, and Renewal presented by Muyon Danyela Mafulu _________ This curatorial exhibition aims to bring together African artists whose practices move through ancestral memory, spiritual lineage and the living archive. This exhibition considers how contemporary art functions as a vessel between ancestral resonance and a space of renewal. Here, this history is not only seen as a safeguard but also reshapes the way in which artists reimagine and create a sense of belonging. These artists aim to resist the confines of Eurocentric frameworks, offering African art as an evolving practice that is spiritually rooted. Rather than positioning African art as a static tradition or a symbol of postcolonial struggle, Living Archives: Ancestral currents remembering, resonance and renewal aims to invite viewers into a space of contemplation, connection, and transformation. Through a curated selection of diverse practices, the exhibition reveals how Contemporary African draw on the depth of their cultural inheritance – personal, spiritual and historical – to craft work that is complex, intimate, and resistant. Living Archives: Ancestral currents remembering, resonance and renewal affirms that African contemporary art is not fixed in time. Through painting, photography, installation and mixed media, the artists engage with archives that are both personal and collective, tangible and intangible, material and immaterial. Their work references a sense of belonging, spiritual lineage, colonial past and everyday strategies or survival and adaptation. In doing so, art becomes a visual language of continuity, preserving memory, while creating space that resists erasure and invites transformation. The exhibition serves as a living archive—where past and present converge to become vessels for cultural, historical, and spiritual renewal. The featured artists respond to urban life, ancestral memory, and social change in ways that challenge reductive narratives and celebrate layered African realities. Their works are not merely illustrations of heritage; they embody theory, critique, and visionary insight. They speak on their own terms, with authority, rather than seeking validation from Western institutions. It is dynamic, globally engaged, and deeply reflective of its local and spiritual contexts. It challenges dominant frameworks by centering artists who use their practices to question, remember, and imagine. This exhibition focuses on the connection between Francophone and Anglophone Africa context, highlighting how African artists use their practice to respond to colonial histories, while still positioning themselves within a cultural landscape. Through this exchange, art-making becomes a site of belonging, where the weight of history sparks visions of renewal. Their work are not merely illustrations of heritage, they embody theory, critique, and visionary insight. In this sense, African artists from West and Central Africa — regardless of the countries they currently reside in—use art-based practices to explore and express the poetics of urban life, diasporic identity, and intergenerational knowledge. Through their work, images become dynamic sites of preservation and transformation, capturing the essence of home and cultural memory while continuously reinterpreting what it means to belong. This artistic lens bridges distances and histories, allowing artists to hold space for fluid, living archives that resonate across borders. This exhibition understands memory not as something fixed, but as a living archive. Renewal is seen not as rupture, but as a cyclical movement that carries ancestral presence forward while nurturing the emergence of new artistic forms. It calls for a broader understanding of how spirituality, memory, and history continue to shape artistic innovation. These voices are not peripheral—they are central to how the works are framed, interpreted, and experienced. It aims to open a space for meaningful pan-African dialogue—bridging the artistic and spiritual landscapes of West, and Central Africa. It cultivates connection between artists, publics, and gallery space while resisting the flattening of African creativity into a singular narrative. This is not just an exhibition. It is a reclamation. A statement of multiplicity. A call to listen—deeply and differently—to the resonant and renewing currents of African contemporary art. _______ Above Artwork Details: mixed media of artworks by Muyon Danyela Mafulu EXHIBITION CURATOR, MUYON DANYELA MAFULU Muyon Danyela Mafulu is a South African-born curator and researcher of Congolese and Namibian heritage. Rooted in Congolese heritage, her curatorial practice seeks to amplify Congolese artistic voices while creating a space that connects local practices within the African diaspora and the global audience. She is completing her Master’s in Art History, where her research explored the tension between preservation and innovation in Congolese art. Focusing on Popular Painting in the DRC, studied through the lens of memory, ancestral lineages and contemporary art. Through this research, her understanding of how Congolese artists interlace personal, communal and spiritual narratives, creating living archives that carry both resilience and the promise of renewal. Muyon’s curatorial vision and approach are centred around African artists from underrepresented African regions (West and Central Africa), with a commitment to resisting reductive, Eurocentric frameworks. Her practice combines critical research with a relational approach that honours artists’ authority to reclaim archives as living, spiritual, and intellectual legacies. Through this project and her wider work, Muyon seeks to open spaces for pan-African dialogue that affirms West and Central African contemporary art as complex, dynamic, and self-defined. She aims to build bridges between artists, publics, and institutions, using curating as a tool for cultural reclamation, theory, and renewal. window.sliderConfig1762767006369 = function() { var numberSlides = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.bggle--slider[section-id=&apos;1762767006369&apos;] .image-slider&quot;); if (numberSlides.length &gt; 0) { window.slider1762767006369 = tns({ container: &apos;.bggle--slider[section-id=&quot;1762767006369&quot;]&apos;, items: 1, slideBy: &apos;page&apos;, autoplay: true, gutter: 10, navAsThumbnails: false, navPosition: &quot;bottom&quot;, arrowKeys: true, autoHeight:true, autoplayButton: false, autoplayButtonOutput: false, mouseDrag: true, autoplay: true, responsive: { 768: { items: 1 }, 1025: { items: 1 } } }); } }; document.addEventListener(&apos;init-slider-1762767006369&apos;, window.sliderConfig1762767006369) Resonance (Memory &amp; Lineage) These artists offer portals into lived memory—spaces where the sacred and everyday coexist.

      <description>Oneness presented by Palesa Ngwenya ______ Belief is firmly rooted in Black South African cultures, not only as theory, but as a way of belonging and being. Faith is nurtured and strengthened by shared practice, repeated gestures and communal bonds. The artworks shown here invite viewers to consider how belief shapes identity and how a sense of oneness grows when individuals search for meaning together. This exhibition aims to encourage us to focus on our shared human need for connection and fullness rather than the differences that exist across beliefs. ______ Banner Artwork Details: Mandisa Buthelezi, AmaNazaretha 2, 2018, Archival Ink Print on Cotton Rag, Image size: 790 x 544 mm, Sheet size: 840 x 594 mm, R12 500 ex VAT, CONTACT TO BUY.

With a deep interest in culture, spirituality, identity, memory, womanhood, and tradition, her practice is driven by the desire to make people feel seen. She is particularly fascinated by the duality of life and human beings, how joy and grief, tradition and modernity, strength and vulnerability often coexist. She believes storytelling is a powerful way to hold this complexity and to spark healing, dialogue, and recognition. Palesa curates with the intention of creating spaces that feel familiar, reflective, and emotionally resonant. She is drawn to quiet conversations and the intimate details of everyday life. Though still new to curating, she brings a strong sense of observation and concept development to her process, with a personal love for conceptual thinking. Her background in design and storytelling, along with her experience working at Latitudes, continues to inform and shape her curatorial perspective, deepening her understanding of artists, audiences, and the evolving art ecosystem. Her practice is rooted in care, attentiveness, and imagination as she grows into her own artistic and curatorial voice. This exhibition begins with an observation: the persistence of spirituality. Within Black South African cultures, belief is not placed at the margins of life. It informs how people belong, how identity is affirmed, and how meaning in self is sustained. The conversation shouldn&apos;t be so much about whether one believes, or even whether their belief is more accurate. Rather, it should be about the common experience of living by faith and the relationship between identity, spirituality and the pursuit of meaning. At the core of this exhibition is the subject of the complexity of belief and how it forms identity. Belief provides a framework, but the sense of community it fosters is what keeps it nourished. It requires maintenance. It is carried out through repeated actions, attention to detail in daily life, and relationships with objects, spaces, and others. Shared belief becomes shared feeling . The act of practising belief is, in itself, a journey of self-discovery. To explore one’s faith is to travel inward, to confront, question, and rediscover the self. Even when that exploration aligns with a specific faith or religion, it remains a deeply personal voyage toward understanding and becoming. This inward travel mirrors the outward expressions of faith, revealing that belief is not only about connecting with something beyond, but also about finding one’s place within. It thus becomes more about the feeling of belonging, the sense of oneness that arises from being with others who share in the intangible experience of seeking something beyond themselves. This is why beliefs, even when they appear to clash, remain so powerful: they are carried not only in words or rituals, but also in the lived feeling of connection and the identity they affirm.

They focus on highlighting the practices and unseen bonds that exist that bind us together, rather than presenting religion as a closed system. This exhibition aims to encourage conversation and deepen reflection by inviting viewers to look within as well as outward, to see spirituality as a common human experience of seeking, belonging, and becoming whole, rather than just a sign of cultural continuity. Oneness is not abstract in this sense. It is a lived practice, carried out in daily rituals, communal gatherings, and personal reflections. It is an experience of wholeness that is deeply personal, yet undeniably communal. This exhibition seeks to hold space for conversation and reflection on that experience. It asks us to think less about the lines that divide one belief from another, and more about the grounds they share, the longing for oneness rooted in us, the strength of community, and the value such experiences bring to the self.

      <description>Standing As An Observer Of History presented by Reem Aljeally ______ Conflict and war shape our experiences and definitions socially, and art is no different. Most artists from conflict-affected regions find their work defined by these circumstances, whether they embrace or resist this lens. Since April 2023, many Sudanese art exhibitions have been framed politically or nostalgically, but as a curator, I ask: who is thinking of the art itself? How does the environment affect visual memory and artistic production? Reflecting on my own work, I noticed how time, change, and exile transformed my paintings from intimate interiors to isolated figures in undefined spaces, opening new horizons of seeing. This collection explores visual transformations carrying layers of political, social, and emotional meaning. “Standing As An Observer Of History” positions the artwork and its creator as witnesses to change, not to tell or analyze history, but to observe movement and stagnation amid liminality. The selected artists investigate how temporal liminality reshapes visual and social relations, revealing resilience and quiet strength in stillness. _______ Banner Artwork Details: Waleed Mohammed, Untitled, 2025, Acrylic on canvas, 12 x 16 cm, CONTACT TO BUY .

She is the Founder of The Muse multi studios (2019) and The Sudan Art Archive (2022), aiming to support, promote, and preserve visual arts in Sudan. Her artistic practice focuses on painting, installation, and printmaking exploring themes of space, memory, movement, and self-image. She has exhibited internationally in Germany, Spain, UK, Russia, Portugal, The United States, Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa. In 2025, Reem received the 2nd place runner up for the ANNA Award by Latitudes Online. Mozafar Ramadan, Temporary 13, 2025, Printing ink on cardboard, 20 x 20 cm, R3,450.92 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY.

While the relationship between the artist, the artwork, and the surrounding environment is not new, this collection seeks to reexamine it through the lens of visual transformation - abrupt or gradual - carrying political, social, economic, and emotional layers. Standing As An Observer Of History positions the artwork, and by extension the artist, as a witness to change, not to narrate or analyze, but to quietly observe the tension between movement and stillness in estranged environments. Though this stance may seem detached, it is a deliberate act of endurance: a refusal to reduce lived realities into singular narratives. The selected works by Almogera Abdelbagi, Mozafar Ramadan, Waleed Mohammed, Amani Azhari, and Reem Aljeally interrogate how temporal liminality reshapes visual perception, behavior, and spatial relations.

In Humanities, Almogera Abdelbagi - known for his vibrant palettes - subdues both background and figure, muting color into smudges of darkness that mirror the spiritual erosion caused by waiting. His obscured compositions visualize instability and reveal how upheaval transforms the artist’s internal landscape. Amani Azhari extends this inquiry through paintings of vividly dressed women performing ritualized gestures. Her figures inhabit thresholds - neither advancing nor retreating - yet their repetition asserts agency within constraint, grounding female solidarity in intimate spaces.

Waleed Mohammed’s practice moves from archival recreation to reimagination. Working between Nairobi and Kampala, he explores histories of displacement and fractured memory, tracing how archival images connect across distances and time. In contrast, Mozafar Ramadan turns toward land and ecology as witnesses of transformation. His recent collection Temporary layers recycled materials and repetition, centered on the Al-Aushar plant (Calotropis Procera), resilient in harsh Sudanese landscapes. Mimicking its adaptability, Ramadan parallels his navigation of new geographies, where memory decays into abstraction. His work rejects catastrophic temporality, proposing alternative rhythms that resist collapse. Amani Azhari, Cinnamon Colored Girls 1, Acrylic, oil pastel, 2025, collage on paper, 30 × 55 cm, R8,627.31ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY. This collection reframes these artists’ realities through the lens of temporality, revealing how their work captures suspended existence, where resilience emerges in liminality, and the ephemeral becomes a site of reimagined futures. While the artworks in their visual output strip away context, their realities and circumstances of creation ask how identity persists when external markers dissolve. Through their nuanced portrayals of waiting, solitude, and endurance, the artists reveal how moments of stillness are charged with quiet strength, transforming passivity into profound acts of survival and hope in times of uncertainty.

      <description>The Weight of Soft Things presented by Nafkot Gebeyehu ______ The emotional lives of young women are often undocumented, particularly in African societies where tradition still defines what should be seen, said, and shared. In Ethiopia, vulnerability is often met with silence or spiritual platitude. Feelings, especially those that are heavy, shapeless, or unresolved rarely find form, let alone space. The Weight of Soft Things brings together five emerging Ethiopian women artists who confront this absence by placing emotional life at the center of their work. Across collage, painting and photography these artists explore memory, mental health, grief, isolation, and the emotional toll of caregiving and survival. Each body of work is shaped by personal experience: the stillness of unemployment, the aftermath of war, the fatigue of caregiving, or the simple rituals that make memory bearable. What binds them is an insistence that what happens inside us matters: psychologically, socially, and politically. Softness, whether it’s emotion, memory, or unspoken grief, carries weight. It isn’t decorative. It isn’t optional. It has real consequences on how we live, how we see ourselves, and how we move through the world. These artists refuse the idea that internal life is secondary or indulgent. Instead, they build visual languages that translate emotional labor into textured, layered forms. What happens to us when we cannot name what we feel? When there is no space to unravel, reflect, or simply be? What does it cost to carry everything alone, silently and for a prolonged period of time? This exhibit does not offer closure. Instead, it invites the viewer to take these questions seriously: to pay attention to the states we are told to push aside. To imagine what a culture might look like if emotional life was not a private burden, but a shared language. These questions are deeply political, especially in a time when Ethiopia is undergoing rapid transformation without room for emotional reckoning. As tradition frays and new norms emerge, the artists in this exhibition document the psychological residue of change. Their work becomes a counter-archive, a record of what isn’t often said but collectively felt. _____ Banner Artwork Details: Ribka Sisay, Fear Towers, 2024, 40cm x 60cm, Mixed media (photo print on canvas, yarn), R16,800 ex.

      <description>What We Don’t See: A Sensory Rebellion presented by Diarietou Nasradine Diop ______ What We Don’t See: A Sensory Rebellion explores how art moves beyond the visible, revealing a world perceived through sound, texture, rhythm, and silence. The exhibition questions the dominance of sight in the way we experience and interpret art, reimagining perception as a multisensory field where emotion, material, and memory shape the act of seeing. Across painting, photography, textile, and sculpture, the participating artists invite audiences to sense rather than simply observe. Thandiwe Muriu’s vivid portraits transform pattern into language, reclaiming visibility and identity through rhythm and color. Nnenna Okore’s organic installations evoke the tactility of breath and renewal. Tommy Motswai’s expressive prints vibrate with sound and human energy, while Mahmoud Bâba Ly’s textured abstractions question movement and direction in uncertain terrains. Raymond Fuyana’s vibrant worlds transform silence into visual rhythm, and Yaay Hawa Fall’s meditative portraits embody the breath between presence and absence. Through Djibril Dramé’s spiritually charged compositions, Isabella Maake’s cyanotypes of invisible space, and April Kamunde’s serene explorations of rest, the exhibition unfolds as a sensory conversation between stillness and resonance, material and void, surface and depth. At its core, What We Don’t See proposes that art is not confined to what the eye can capture. It gestures toward a collective awareness that perception is a shared and layered experience that unites the senses, dissolves boundaries, and opens space for empathy. In this way, the exhibition becomes both rebellion and invitation. A call to listen with the eyes closed and to rediscover what presence means beyond vision. ______ Banner Artwork Details: Raymond Fuyana, Toybox III (2024) Acrylic and oil on canvas, 124 × 180 cm Courtesy of Guns &amp; Rain Gallery, Johannesburg Raymond Fuyana, Toybox III (2024), Acrylic and oil on canvas, 124 × 180 cm, Courtesy of Guns &amp; Rain Gallery, Johannesburg, CONTACT TO BUY .

Her curatorial work explores how art can transcend the dominance of sight by engaging touch, sound, and emotion as vital forms of knowledge and connection. She is participating in the RMB Latitudes CuratorLab 2025, developing the exhibition What We Don’t See: A Sensory Rebellion, which examines how multisensory experience can transform the ways we perceive and relate to art. Her approach is informed by a background in architecture and her ongoing research on accessibility, universal design, and the relationship between space and the senses. Before joining the CuratorLab, Diarietou worked on artistic and architectural initiatives across West and North Africa, as well as in Saudi Arabia, combining community engagement, spatial research, and artistic collaboration. She continues to develop projects that unite creative disciplines and emphasize empathy, inclusion, and the human experience at the center of design and curation. Where Are We Going?

      <title>Wonder In Sonder: Take a walk with me</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/wonder-in-sonder-take-a-walk-with-me</link>
      <description>Wonder In Sonder: Take a walk with me presented by Sinki Makubu _______ “Take a walk with me” An invitation to accompany another through the paths they navigate. This exhibition extends that call, walking alongside narratives shaped by South Africa’s enduring traumas and the identities forged within them. It retraces the long walk once framed as a journey to freedom. A walk that promised unity and equality but left uneven footprints on a divided land. Thabo Mbeki’s 1996 I Am an African speech captured the dream of shared belonging: “South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white.” Yet decades later, inequality persists. The promise of freedom has become a daily balancing act—between aspiration and limitation, belonging and exclusion. The imagined “rainbow nation” remains fractured, its hues dimmed by enduring disparities that live on in economy, education, and everyday life. Wonder in Sonder walks through this tension, asking: what does it mean to move through a country still stitched together by old seams of separation? Across three interwoven spectrums; homestand, self-actualisation, and spiritual fulfilment. The exhibition explores how South Africans rebuild, redefine, and reclaim meaning within inherited boundaries. Homestand reflects on resourcefulness, how communities make do with what lies within reach, creating worlds from limited means. It considers the pride, labour, and memory embedded in the everyday, and how people craft belonging even within constraint. Self-actualisation turns inward, tracing how identity unfolds within and against communal expectation. It reflects on what it means to walk tall in spaces that question one’s right to be. How survival becomes a choreography of negotiation between vulnerability and strength, self and society. Spiritual fulfilment anchors the final leg of this walk. In Africa, spirituality moves beside daily life, sometimes as guide, sometimes as warning. It shapes how people navigate the visible and the unseen, grounding faith, doubt, and renewal within the same step. Wonder in Sonder reframes walking as both method and metaphor: a way of seeing, feeling, and being-with. To walk is to listen, to accompany, to remember. It suggests that freedom is not a destination reached, but a movement continuously practised. A rhythm carried in the body and shared across generations. In a country where walking has always been political, whether to march, to migrate, to seek work, or to return home. Every step carries history. This exhibition invites viewers to slow their pace, to notice. Wonder in Sonder is a walk through that shared terrain: uneven, tender, and unending.

      <title>The Impossibility of Presence:</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/the-impossibility-of-presence</link>
      <description>The Impossibility of Presence: Oupa Sibeko and Performance as Refusal - by Nkhensani Mkhari Oupa Sibeko, Sandpaper series VII, 2025, R5,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY . &quot;The impossibility of Black performance&quot; is not Fred Moten&apos;s diagnosis of failure. It is his articulation of a paradox: that Black performance both enacts and refuses visibility, that it appears within the field of representation only to exceed it, that it cannot be fully apprehended or contained within the dominant logics of aesthetics precisely because it is always entangled with capture, spectacle, and commodification. Black performance is impossible not because it doesn&apos;t exist, but because it exists otherwise—fugitively, excessively, in the break. This impossibility finds urgent resonance in the South African context, where the art market&apos;s commodity logic collides with performance&apos;s fundamental resistance to capture. You cannot hang performance on a wall. You cannot sell it in the same way you sell a painting or sculpture. In a country where commercial galleries dominate the cultural landscape and biennials remain scarce, where alternative modes of exhibition-making struggle for institutional support, performance exists as what we might call a peripheral medium—peripheral not in importance but in its structural refusal of the market&apos;s central mechanisms of value extraction and circulation. Performance in the Deathworld: Necropolitics and the Market Achille Mbembe, Research Professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, theorizes &quot;necropolitics&quot; as the deployment of social and political power to dictate how some people may live and how some must die, creating what he calls &quot;deathworlds&quot;—&quot;new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjected to living conditions that confer upon them the status of the living dead.&quot; Wikipedia Uu But necropolitics operates not only through state violence. It structures the art world itself, determining which cultural forms can circulate, accumulate value, and confer status upon their makers. In South Africa&apos;s highly commercialized art sector, the gallery system privileges object-based practices that can be bought, sold, and displayed—paintings, sculptures, photographs that become assets in private collections. Mbembe argues that the consequences of reducing Africans to objects under colonialism never faded but continue to haunt postcolonial structures. Springer The art market extends this logic of objectification: art itself must become object to enter circuits of capital accumulation. Performance, in its temporal unfolding and spatial specificity, refuses this reduction. It cannot be possessed in the same way. It resists what Mbembe identifies as capitalism&apos;s &quot;compulsion to categorize, to separate, to measure, and to name, to classify and to establish equivalences between things.&quot; This is why performance remains peripheral in South Africa despite—or perhaps because of—the vibrancy of its historical tradition. The theatre of resistance under apartheid, the collaborative experiments at the Market Theatre, the township musicals that drew from indigenous performance forms: all existed in complex relation to commodification, often operating outside or against market logics even as they sought audiences and sustainability. In the post-apartheid moment, as the gallery system consolidated and the commercial art market expanded, performance found itself increasingly marginalized within institutional frameworks designed around the circulation of saleable objects. window.sliderConfig1765435880562 = function() { var numberSlides = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.bggle--slider[section-id=&apos;1765435880562&apos;] .image-slider&quot;); if (numberSlides.length &gt; 0) { window.slider1765435880562 = tns({ container: &apos;.bggle--slider[section-id=&quot;1765435880562&quot;]&apos;, items: 1, slideBy: &apos;page&apos;, autoplay: true, gutter: 10, navAsThumbnails: false, navPosition: &quot;bottom&quot;, arrowKeys: true, autoHeight:true, autoplayButton: false, autoplayButtonOutput: false, mouseDrag: true, autoplay: true, responsive: { 768: { items: 1 }, 1025: { items: 1 } } }); } }; document.addEventListener(&apos;init-slider-1765435880562&apos;, window.sliderConfig1765435880562) Forking Knife: Performance as Confrontation I remember my first encounter with Oupa Sibeko&apos;s work at FNB Art Joburg in 2019, before the pandemic reconfigured our relationship to public gathering and physical presence. I was working a booth for the gallery BKhz, immersed in the familiar rhythms of the art fair—the hushed negotiations, the calculated displays, the circulation of collectors and dealers assessing objects for acquisition. Then came the clatter. In all the humdrum, Sibeko appeared, naked, moving through the walkways on a donkey cart throwing Monopoly money in the air, pulled by his collaborator Benjamin Skinner, his long hair wet dripping on an oversized suit, barefoot, carrying Oupa in a large three-legged cast-iron pot we call a ‘drie-foot’ on the cart. The performance, titled Forking Knife , created immediate disruption. The donkey cart—that vehicle of rural labour and historical dispossession—invaded the sanitized space of the contemporary art fair. The cast-iron pot evoked domestic labour, cooking, sustenance: the realm of the everyday that Njabulo Ndebele called for in his critique of spectacular protest art, yet here deployed not as retreat into ordinariness but as confrontation with the extraordinary violence embedded in ordinary relations. Oupa Sibeko, Biting the Bullet I, 2025, R7,500.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY . The performance forced questions the fair&apos;s spatial organization sought to suppress: What bodies belong in this space? What forms of labour are visible and valued? How do black and white bodies relate to art—as makers, as subjects, as labour, as spectacle? Sibeko in the pot throwing monopoly money, carried on Skinner back recalled histories of forced labour, of bodies reduced to their capacity to carry, to serve, to produce value for others. The donkey cart moving through aisles of expensive artworks created what Moten might call &quot;the scene of subjection&quot;—making visible the continued operation of colonial logics within contemporary cultural economies. But Forking Knife was not documentation of oppression for collector consumption. It was refusal. The performance could not be bought by the collectors circulating through the fair. It could not be installed in their homes, added to their portfolios, used to consolidate their cultural capital. It happened and then it was gone, leaving only memory, rumour, the traces carried by those who witnessed it. This is the impossibility Moten describes: Black performance that appears within systems designed to capture it yet exceeds those systems&apos; capacity for containment. The Peripheral as Strategy: Ritual, Residency, and Institutional Navigation Sibeko&apos;s current position as artist in residence at the University of Johannesburg—part of a two-year programme hosting sixteen artists including Brenton Maart, Mai Al Shazly, and Carol-Ann Davids—demonstrates how performance practitioners navigate South Africa&apos;s limited institutional landscape. In the absence of well-funded biennials or sustained support for experimental practice, university residencies become crucial sites for research and development. Yet this reliance on academic institutions rather than dedicated performance venues or curatorial platforms reveals the structural marginalization of the medium. His recent work at Nirox Sculpture Park, titled &quot;Can a Performance Help Us Remember What the Body Knows?&quot; and hosted by TEDx Johannesburg, positions ritual as climate action. Drawing from African indigenous knowledge systems—particularly around communal performance, theatre in the round, and site-specific work—Sibeko insists on performance as technology of remembrance and ecological care. The body knows what cannot be archived in museum collections or sold through galleries. It carries knowledges that persist through embodied practice, through repetition and variation, through what Diana Taylor calls the &quot;repertoire&quot; rather than the &quot;archive.&quot; This is performance&apos;s power and its peripherality: it operates through transmission rather than possession, through presence rather than permanence, through collective experience rather than individual ownership. In a market-driven art world, these characteristics mark it as economically marginal. Yet they also mark it as epistemologically central—as a form that maintains connection to ways of knowing and being that resist commodification. Oupa Sibeko, Sublimate, 2024, R18,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY. Beyond the Wall: Toward Alternative Frameworks Njabulo Ndebele argued in &quot;The Rediscovery of the Ordinary&quot; that South African writing had become trapped in spectacular protest, reducing complex realities to legible political statements. He called for literature that could attend to the texture of everyday life, to the subtle operations of power and possibility beyond the dramatic confrontations that dominated anti-apartheid cultural production. Yet the problem was never spectacle itself but rather the ways commodity logics constrain what forms of spectacle become visible and valued. Sibeko&apos;s practice suggests that performance can be both spectacular and subtle, confrontational and careful, impossible to capture yet deeply present. His collaboration with David Krut Projects on Bench Play —creating works on paper through crumpling, tracing spontaneous forms, layering lines and colours—demonstrates how performance practitioners must often produce objects to sustain their practices financially. The works embody what Sibeko identifies as &quot;the rhythms of the workshop space itself: the logo, the shadows, the voices, the air, the simple act of sitting outside with coffee.&quot; They translate performance&apos;s attention to process and collaboration into forms the market can accommodate. But this translation is always incomplete, always a compromise. The works on paper cannot fully contain the collaborative methodology that generated them, cannot reproduce the affective dimensions of shared labour and experimentation. They are traces, residues, offerings to a system that demands objects while the performance itself remains elsewhere—fugitive, excessive, impossible. The Serious Work of Peripheral Practice Mbembe writes that &quot;war has become the sacrament of our times in a conception of sovereignty that operates by annihilating all those considered enemies of the state.&quot; Duke University Press But there are other sacraments, other forms of communion and collective practice that insist on life within deathworlds. Sibeko&apos;s performances at art fairs and sculpture parks, his residency work at UJ, his ritual engagements with ecological crisis: all enact what might be called sacramental refusal—ceremonies of presence that acknowledge their own impossibility while happening anyway. Performance&apos;s peripherality in South Africa&apos;s commercial art sector is not failure but feature. It marks a practice that exceeds the market&apos;s organizing logics, that maintains connection to histories of resistance and communal practice that cannot be reduced to objects for acquisition. In a context where biennials remain scarce and alternative exhibition frameworks struggle for support, performance persists through other means: university residencies, artist-run initiatives, temporary occupations of commercial spaces like art fairs, collaborations with institutions like Nirox that provide platforms outside gallery circuits. The question is not how to make performance more central—how to render it legible to market logics, how to make it sellable, how to hang it on walls. The question is how to sustain peripheral practices, how to build infrastructure for forms that refuse capture, how to value what cannot be possessed. Sibeko&apos;s work reminds us that some things must remain impossible—not absent but present otherwise, not captured but fugitive, not for sale but shared in the break between commodity and gift, between spectacle and ritual, between the market&apos;s demand for objects and the body&apos;s insistence on knowledge that cannot be contained.

      <title>Interview with Japan-based curator and collector Dexter Wimberly</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/interviews/interview-with-japan-based-curator-and-collector-dexter-wimberly</link>
      <description>Interview with Japan-based curator and collector Dexter Wimberly Latitudes’ Chelsea Selvan caught up with Dexter Wimberly, the American entrepreneur and Hayama, Japan–based curator redefining contemporary narratives. Dexter Wimberly is the co-founder of the online education platform CreativeStudy. Wimberly has organized exhibitions in galleries and museums around the world including the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City, The Green Family Art Foundation in Dallas, BODE in Berlin, The Harvey B. Gantt Center in Charlotte, The Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco, KOKI Arts in Tokyo, and The Third Line in Dubai. His exhibitions have been reviewed and featured in publications including The New York Times and Artforum, and have received support from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and The Kinkade Family Foundation. Wimberly is a Senior Critic at New York Academy of Art, and the founder and director of the Hayama Artist Residency in Japan. Prior to his curatorial career, Wimberly was the managing partner of the New York-based advertising and marketing agency August Bishop, representing a diverse array of clients including Adidas, The Coca-Cola Company, and HBO. Wimberly is the curator of The Shape of Things to Come at Efie Gallery in Dubai, running until 10 January 2026. The exhibition brings together works by El Anatsui, Iman Issa, Abdoulaye Konaté, Adam Pendleton, Yinka Shonibare and Carrie Mae Weems. Explore the interview below. ------------------------ Latitudes Online (LO): You&apos;ve brought together artists whose practices span Africa, Europe and the U.S., yet the exhibition&apos;s ideas feel universal - transformation, resilience and renewal. Why did you feel now was the right moment to explore these themes through African and diasporic voices, and why in Dubai? And what guided your curatorial thinking in bringing these particular artists into conversation? Dexter Wimberly (DW): I think we&apos;re living through a moment of profound uncertainty — politically, environmentally, culturally. And when you&apos;re in that kind of turbulence, it&apos;s easy to feel like you&apos;re just waiting for whatever comes next. But these six artists — El Anatsui, Carrie Mae Weems, Abdoulaye Konaté, Yinka Shonibare, Iman Issa, and Adam Pendleton — remind us that we&apos;re not passive observers. We shape what&apos;s ahead through conscious decisions and deliberate actions. Every work in this show began as an idea in the artist&apos;s imagination before becoming tangible reality. That process itself is an assertion of agency. As for timing and location: Dubai&apos;s position as a global crossroads makes it an ideal setting for this conversation. The city sits at the intersection of Africa, the Middle East, and the broader Global South. There&apos;s an openness here, a hunger for new narratives. Efie Gallery, with its mission rooted in the concept of &quot;home&quot;—efie in Twi—has created exactly the kind of environment where diverse global voices don&apos;t just coexist but genuinely converse with and enrich each other. What drew me to these particular artists is that they all work at the junction between historical memory and contemporary urgency. They&apos;re not just documenting change—they&apos;re actively participating in shaping it. Shonibare and Issa both interrogate how historical narratives are constructed and who gets to tell those stories. In a place like Dubai where identity is already hybrid, where colonial histories intersect with contemporary global capital, these questions resonate powerfully. Anatsui transforms discarded materials into new cultural narratives that transcend borders. Konaté grounds urgent global concerns in the deeply local language of West African textile traditions. Pendleton uses Black Dada to merge radical experimentation with the politics of representation. And Weems&apos; 1993 Africa series remains remarkably prescient in its examination of how power and memory are encoded in built environments. Their practices converge in a shared insistence on art&apos;s capacity to both witness and catalyze transformation. Install view, The Shape of Things to Come, Efie Gallery, Dubai, 2025. LO: Dubai has become a hub for collectors and institutions interested in art from Africa. What kinds of conversations do you hope this show sparks among Middle Eastern and African audiences? DW: I hope it generates conversations about belonging, authenticity, and how we define heritage in a globalized world. One of the most fascinating aspects of showing this work in Dubai is that the city itself embodies many of the tensions and possibilities these artists explore. It&apos;s a place of rapid transformation, where diverse cultures converge, where tradition and innovation exist side by side. For Middle Eastern audiences, I think works like Issa&apos;s Heritage Studies offer a powerful entry point. She destabilizes the authority of historical objects by stripping them of specific temporal and geographic origins, asking: what survives from the past and how are those remnants reshaped in the present? That question is deeply relevant in a region with such layered histories. Install view, Iman Issa, The Shape of Things to Come, Efie Gallery, Dubai, 2025. For African audiences and those from the diaspora, I hope the exhibition affirms that African and diasporic voices are central to shaping global culture and contemporary artistic discourse—not peripheral to it. When you see Konaté&apos;s monumental textiles or Anatsui&apos;s shimmering sculptures, you&apos;re witnessing practices that are simultaneously rooted in specific cultural traditions and universally resonant. These aren&apos;t artists translating their work for Western audiences; they&apos;re working from positions of strength and clarity about who they are. And for everyone, I hope the show prompts reflection on this fundamental question: Who gets to tell these stories? What gets preserved and what gets forgotten? In an era where narratives are constantly being rewritten—sometimes authentically, sometimes not—these artists model what it means to engage with history rigorously and imaginatively. LO: The Kyoto Retreat and The Shape of Things to Come both foreground slow, intentional artistic inquiry. How do you balance that slower process of thinking and making with the pace and visibility demanded by today&apos;s art world? DW: This is something I think about constantly, especially since founding the Hayama Artist Residency and now The Kyoto Retreat. Over the years, I&apos;ve had conversations with hundreds of artists, and one thing that stands out is that nearly everyone is pressed for time. For artists, a lack of time is detrimental to career development, mental health, and the quality of work they can produce. The residency programs are my attempt to create an antidote to that pressure. I want to give artists the time and space necessary to slow down, take stock, and make plans for the future. When I was unexpectedly living in Hayama for three months during the pandemic, I experienced firsthand how profound that slowing down can be. Being there made me feel safe when the rest of the world seemed to be falling apart. I developed a more intimate relationship with the place, and I realized this was something I needed to share with others. But here&apos;s the thing — it&apos;s not about rejecting visibility or the professional demands of the art world. The Hayama Residency includes an exhibition and meetings with curators and gallerists in Japan. It&apos;s a real career-building opportunity. The Kyoto Retreat offers the same balance. The goal is to create space for quiet reflection while also opening doors. As for my curatorial practice, I try to embody that same philosophy. When I&apos;m working on an exhibition like The Shape of Things to Come, I&apos;m not interested in rushing to follow trends or creating spectacle for its own sake. I&apos;m interested in artists whose practices have depth, who&apos;ve been thinking deeply about their work for years or decades. That slower, more intentional approach produces work that endures. And ultimately, that&apos;s what matters — not being the loudest voice in the moment, but creating something that will continue to resonate. Install view, Carrie Mae Weems, The Shape of Things to Come, Efie Gallery, Dubai, 2025. LO: You&apos;ve curated internationally while maintaining a strong connection to artists from Africa and the diaspora. How do you navigate curating these narratives within global contexts - and what responsibilities come with that? DW: I take this responsibility very seriously. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1980s — in Bedford-Stuyvesant specifically — and that shaped me profoundly. I witnessed both the beauty and the struggle of that time and place. When I entered the art world, I came with a clear sense of purpose: I wanted to work with artists who reflect our times, who bring the beauty of under-exposed aspects of modern life to a greater public. I feel that this is my calling within the arts. Curatorially, I focus on contemporary urban history and on practices that have been historically marginalised or misunderstood. That means presenting their work in ways that honor both specificity and universality. When I curated Black Abstractionists From Then &apos;til Now at the Green Family Art Foundation in Dallas, the goal was to show how Black artists have been pushing abstraction forward for over a century—not as a response to European modernism, but as an independent, generative force. That exhibition included 38 artists from Frank Bowling to Jack Whitten to Rashid Johnson. The responsibility there was to show the breadth and depth of these practices without flattening their differences. In a global context, the responsibility also includes being thoughtful about where and how work is shown. Dubai is strategically important because it&apos;s a bridge between Africa, the Middle East, and the Global South. Working with Efie Gallery, which was founded by a Ghanaian family and explicitly centers belonging and identity, means the geographical context supports the work rather than tokenizing it. I also think there&apos;s a responsibility to younger artists and curators. That&apos;s why I am a Senior Critic at the New York Academy of Art, and why I run these residencies. It&apos;s about creating pathways, opening doors, sharing resources. Curating has always been a gateway for me — it&apos;s about building lasting relationships with artists and creating opportunities for them to thrive. LO: At Latitudes, we think a lot about how digital and physical platforms can build bridges between artists, collectors and curators across regions. From your perspective, what does a truly global, interconnected art ecosystem look like - and what role do you see curators playing in it? DW: A truly global ecosystem would be one where geography doesn&apos;t determine access or legitimacy. Where an artist in Lagos or Cairo or Tokyo has the same opportunities to develop their practice, show their work, and connect with audiences as someone in New York or London. We&apos;re getting closer to that in some ways — digital platforms have democratized visibility, and institutions in places like Dubai are creating new centers of gravity. But we still have a long way to go. The digital component is crucial, but it can&apos;t replace physical encounters with art. There&apos;s something that happens when you stand in front of one of El Anatsui&apos;s sculptures — the way light moves across the surface, the tactile sense of weight and fragility, the scale — that you simply can&apos;t replicate on a screen. Similarly, the social dimension of the art world — the conversations that happen at openings, the relationships built over studio visits — still requires embodied presence. El Anatsui, 5.63° N, 0.00° E, 2025, aluminium bottle caps and copper wire, 270 cm x 200 cm, courtesy the artist and Efie Gallery, Dubai. So I think the ideal is a hybrid model. Digital platforms can build awareness, create initial connections, facilitate research. But they need to lead to physical encounters. That&apos;s partly why I&apos;m so invested in residency programs. The Hayama Artist Residency and The Kyoto Retreat bring people from all over the world to Japan for sustained periods of time. That&apos;s where real exchange happens—not in a quick Instagram scroll, but in four weeks of living and working alongside other artists, engaging with a different culture, having time to think. As for the curator&apos;s role in this ecosystem: I see us as facilitators, connectors, translators. We help artists reach audiences who might not otherwise encounter their work. We create contexts that allow work to be understood more fully. We build bridges between local and global, between different artistic traditions, between artists at different stages of their careers. But I also think curators need to be willing to challenge existing power structures, not just reproduce them. That means being intentional about which narratives we amplify, which artists we champion, where we choose to show work. It means recognizing that institutions in Dubai, Lagos, Johannesburg, or São Paulo can be just as important as those in New York or London. It means understanding that the canon is always being written, and we have a responsibility to shape it more inclusively. Ultimately, I&apos;m optimistic. I see younger curators who are incredibly thoughtful about these questions. I see institutions becoming more globally minded. I see collectors who genuinely want to support diverse practices. And I see artists who refuse to be limited by geography or category, who are building their own networks and platforms. That&apos;s the ecosystem emerging — one that&apos;s more connected, more equitable, and more dynamic than what came before. window.sliderConfig1765437746267 = function() { var numberSlides = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.bggle--slider[section-id=&apos;1765437746267&apos;] .image-slider&quot;); if (numberSlides.length &gt; 0) { window.slider1765437746267 = tns({ container: &apos;.bggle--slider[section-id=&quot;1765437746267&quot;]&apos;, items: 1, slideBy: &apos;page&apos;, autoplay: true, gutter: 10, navAsThumbnails: false, navPosition: &quot;bottom&quot;, arrowKeys: true, autoHeight:true, autoplayButton: false, autoplayButtonOutput: false, mouseDrag: true, autoplay: true, responsive: { 768: { items: 1 }, 1025: { items: 1 } } }); } }; document.addEventListener(&apos;init-slider-1765437746267&apos;, window.sliderConfig1765437746267) Dexter Wimberly picks his top three works on Latitudes &quot;Raubenheimer&apos;s Flood under Orion masterfully employs charcoal, graphite, and coloured pencil to create a haunting meditation on ecological vulnerability, where the celestial constancy of Orion bears witness to terrestrial inundation with devastating poetic force.

      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/what-s-driving-the-democratisation-of-our-art-market</link>
      <description>What’s driving the democratisation of our art market? - By Mary Corrigall Kea Seema, Until Now The Kingdom Of Heaven Suffereth Violence, 2025, R26,000.00 ex. VAT, CONTACT TO BUY --------------- The accessibility of art has been a perennial topic of discussion in art circles. While art galleries and museums are theoretically open to all, social, economic, educational, cultural, class, and racial barriers often complicate access in practice. Museums, galleries, and art fairs tend to measure success by visitor numbers and sales, prompting a focus on making art accessible to wider audiences. Once limited to the wealthy elite, viewing and buying art has become a common activity among the middle class. The proliferation of art fairs, sponsorship, social media and online platforms, the increase in more affordable art, as well as the rise of artists making art that speaks to the interests of South Africa’s rising classes have all contributed to this shift. However, further efforts are needed to grow the number of collectors required to support South Africa’s continuously expanding art ecosystem. Social Media empowers artists and collectors Social media has disrupted the traditional art world, reducing the role of gallerists as gatekeepers. Artists who use social media can display and sell their work directly to collectors, broadening access and bypassing galleries. This shift has made it easier for artists and collectors to connect globally, with many South African artists selling to buyers outside the country. “A lot of really good artists don&apos;t [have galleries],” observes Barbara Wildenboer, who is represented by the Everard Read gallery. Karin Preller, an independent artist based in Joburg, confirms: “Social media sites have been essential, both in terms of reception and sales.” The recent UBS/Art Basel Collector Report 2025 found this trend to be deepening, showing a significant increase in High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) (63%) buying directly from artists – up from 23% in 2023. Conversely, 71% buy from dealers, down from 91% in 2023. In the same report a pie chart demonstrating HNWI expenditure percentage showed 27% was attributed to dealers, with 20% to artists. As such, social media has played a significant role in democratising the art market. However, this development has also distorted perceptions of the market and has presented difficulties for independent artists and local collectors. As the artworks with the most likes on Instagram are likely to go viral, often it is brightly coloured work that pops on a small digital screen that is ‘the most prized’, which has led to an increase of vacuous viral art that is often disappointing when viewed in person. Many independent South African artists who survive on sales via Instagram to collectors elsewhere in the world rarely exhibit locally or are able to stage conventional exhibitions which enable them to develop their practice. Their work is often unaffordable for local collectors, as international buyers with stronger currencies drive up prices. Art Fairs: where art and socialising collide Corrigall &amp; Co&apos;s analysis, as detailed in 2017’s Contemporary African Art Ecologies , found that commercial art spaces in South Africa increased sharply after the Joburg Art Fair began in 2008. Cape Town’s market has also expanded since an art fair was established in that city in 2012, likely aided by the city’s tourism. Many people who visit art fairs have not previously visited galleries. These events offer newcomers an easy introduction to the art world, allowing them to explore top galleries in the host city and discover artworks from other regions of Africa and beyond. In short, art fairs exude a sense of creative abundance, which draws visitors and activates buyer interest. RMB Latitudes Art Fair 2025, photo by Anthea Pokroy When leading financial institutions assume title sponsorship of art fairs, it reinforces the perception of art as a recognised asset class. This involvement invites their VIP clients and other customers into the art world, which may have previously seemed exclusive to the creative community. Art fairs serve as social gatherings beyond just their opening nights—people from all walks of life mix and mingle throughout the entire event. RMB Latitudes, for instance, demonstrates how a well-chosen venue with bars, lounges, balconies, and garden tables encourages guests to connect and converse between enjoying the art on display. Though there are VIP openings and events that retain the sense of elitism that makes the art world attractive to the wealthy, ultimately art fairs have democratised art viewing and buying. At most fairs there are a range of galleries representing artists at different levels, from the internationally recognised to newcomers, offering works at different price points. It is possible to leave an art fair with an artwork – likely to be an editioned work on paper – for under R5K, though that budget is limiting. Art fairs have democratised the art market itself; the expansion of South Africa’s commercial scene is directly linked to the proliferation of art fairs around the world, which some of our local galleries participate in, allowing them to reach more buyers with different tastes. This has upturned a Western-centric conception of contemporary art and created greater visibility for African artists. However, the high costs of showing at international fairs have seen a decrease in local participation – the latest Corrigall &amp; Co report, African Art Ecosystems 2024, showed that only 22% of SA galleries participate in fairs beyond our borders. This has led to some galleries pooling their resources and sharing a booth at an international fair. Outside of RMB Latitudes Fair, independent artists are typically unable to secure booths – as the model has traditionally depended on galleries doing so. Non-profits, collectives and other types of visual arts organisations also struggle to gain access if they don’t have the financial resources to do so. “The increasing numbers of art fairs globally, the influence of social media, sponsorship, greater affordability, the growing frequency and visibility of auctions, and the digitalisation of art trading have all contributed to making art more accessible,” observes Bina Genovese, director at Strauss &amp; Co, the dominant auction house. Virtual paddles lower barriers The popularity of online auctions, which Covid-19 ushered in, eroding the stigma surrounding buying art online, has democratised the secondary market in a number of ways. Online auctions and online bidding have removed a barrier for potential art collectors who may have felt intimated holding a real-life paddle and brave making a bid in a room full of moneyed people. Young people in particular have been drawn to online auctions, according to Genovese and international art reports. As referenced previously in this series, the Artnet Intelligence 2024 report found that Millennials and Gen Zers accounted for a quarter to a third of bidders and buyers at the two major auction houses in 2024, more than doubling their share in five years. The UBS/Art Basel Collector Report 2025, released in October, however, showed that spending at auctions by HNWI fell, however, Millennials and Boomers seemed to have the highest preference for buying at auction (it didn’t specify whether it was online). Strauss&apos;s local online auctions, which feature lower-valued works than their larger in-person events, have made the secondary art market more accessible. Since Covid-19 and the rise of charity auctions, these online sales now often include pieces by emerging artists, giving them public records and helping establish their art&apos;s value. Image Courtesy: Strauss &amp; Co. However, it can be risky for emerging artists to have their works at auction – if they don’t sell, it may appear as if there isn’t demand for their work. Nevertheless, there is a certain kudos attached to art that is offered at auction – which is associated with art that is valued. Alternative platforms stimulate new art buyers A range of different kinds of easy-to-access events that are focussed on developing audiences and artists at a grass-roots level have been gradually mushrooming across the country. Consider the First Thursdays initiative established in 2012: Although some suggest that its appeal now lies primarily in its social aspects, this monthly event in Cape Town and Johannesburg, which sees galleries open until 8pm, has significantly increased access to art for Gen Z and millennial audiences. These generations, who may have previously felt unwelcome in spaces where purchasing power was expected, have benefited from the inclusive environment fostered by the event. “The role and impact of First Thursdays has been massive,” observes Charl Bezuidenhout, founder of WORLDART Gallery in Cape Town. Contra.Joburg (formerly known as Open Studios) has created a platform for Joburg artists in the myriad shared studios in the inner city to access potential art buyers, which tour these studios via a hop-on-hop-off bus service. Similarly, visitors are given access to artist studios and works that largely don’t make it into galleries or art fairs – as so many of the artists in this programme are independent. The artists tend to create a range of works for sale for the event, which is patronised by young professionals looking to get a taste of the pleasures of buying art. Art Under The Bed is another initiative, which is now staged in both Joburg and Cape Town, that provides a platform for independent and established artists to make affordable works available to the public in a low-key domestic setting, which is free to attend. Joshua Miles, Twenty ten AP 2/2, 2010, R12,000.00 ex. VAT, presented by WORLDART, CONTACT TO BUY “Art under the bed… introduces a lot of artists to a lot of younger collectors… the pop-ups… all serve to demystify the visual arts experience,” says Emma Van der Merwe, director at Everard Read Gallery Cape Town. The Heat Winter Arts Festival, established by Corrigall &amp; Co in 2024, which was designed to invigorate Cape Town’s art scene during its slow winter season, is also focused on access – participating galleries are encouraged to work with artists they haven’t before. With the majority of works offered by emerging artists, the art on offer is within reach of local collectors. Opening night is free to attend. The Emerging Artists You Should Know publication introduces a selection of the rising artists to audiences through texts that aren’t jargon-heavy. Art entrepreneurship is at an all-time high; there has been a flurry of pop-up galleries, exhibitions, talks, curated walkabouts of galleries and quasi-collector groups such as Women Who Collect Art, among others. This is, of course, all a direct spin-off of the democratising forces in the art world. Entry to it no longer has to be negotiated or is conditional, allowing more people to participate in engaging their communities and peers.

      <title>Thrive Through Art Top Three Winners:</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/thrive-through-art-top-three-winners</link>
      <description>Thrive Through Art Top Three Winners: Earlier this year, Latitudes and Thrive Student Living teamed up to spotlight the next generation of creative talent. We invited university and college arts students across South Africa to submit an original artwork into a newly launched competition. The three winners will each win a cash prize, and have their artwork featured on beautifully designed Thrive tote bags, allowing their talent to live and move in the real world. Today, we&apos;re excited to announce the three winning artists! Akhona Anele Njapha Institution : University of Cape Town Department: Humanities Bio : I visualise my faith by giving an image of precious moments in time and the feelings they invoke as well as creating artworks that relate to the world around us, things we go through in life as people along with our differences. I love light and my goal is to spread it all over the world. When people see my work, all I hope for is for them to feel the way that I do when these beautiful visuals and scenarios of my artworks run through my mind, absolute awe. Thapelo Mohlala Institution : Tshwane University of Technology Department : Fine and Applied Arts Bio : I&apos;m a broad artist who deals with variety of mediums when it comes to art. I would like my artwork to remain realistic even if they are designs. I&apos;m a good writer and I love painting this was my first experience using yarn and knitting with a needle. I love art because the interpreter can tell his or her own message using my own art. Art brings peace to me and my walls are full of art and inspiration. Luchia Turtledove Institution : Cape Town Creative Academy Department : BA in Motion Design Bio : My life has been shaped by constant movement, anxiety, and loss, yet art has always remained my grounding force, the thread that holds me together and reminds me of who I am. From a young age, creativity was woven into my world through my mother, whose beautiful artworks and printed textiles continue to inspire me long after her passing. Her memory fuels my determination to create, to tell stories, and to share the moments that have shaped me. Since moving to Cape Town, my life has been illuminated by light, love, and new beginnings. The city and its creative community have given me confidence, a sense of belonging, and a renewed sense of purpose. Through my work, I aim to express gratitude for these connections and to celebrate the people and places that have helped me grow into the artist I strive to be. In a world often overshadowed by violence and division, my art seeks to reveal the beauty, hope, and love that still surround us. I create to remind others, and myself, that even in struggle, there is meaning, and there is always light waiting to be found. window.sliderConfig1765440189344 = function() { var numberSlides = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.bggle--slider[section-id=&apos;1765440189344&apos;] .image-slider&quot;); if (numberSlides.length &gt; 0) { window.slider1765440189344 = tns({ container: &apos;.bggle--slider[section-id=&quot;1765440189344&quot;]&apos;, items: 1, slideBy: &apos;page&apos;, autoplay: true, gutter: 10, navAsThumbnails: false, navPosition: &quot;bottom&quot;, arrowKeys: true, autoHeight:true, autoplayButton: false, autoplayButtonOutput: false, mouseDrag: true, autoplay: true, responsive: { 768: { items: 1 }, 1025: { items: 1 } } }); } }; document.addEventListener(&apos;init-slider-1765440189344&apos;, window.sliderConfig1765440189344) 26 Nov 2025 .m-article__header, .m-article__feature-image { display: none !important; }</description>

      <title>South Africa sets out vision and leadership for the Venice Biennale 2026</title>
      <link>https://latitudes-online.myshopify.com/blogs/art-news/south-africa-sets-out-vision-and-leadership-for-the-venice-biennale-2026</link>
      <description>South Africa sets out vision and leadership for the Venice Biennale 2026 South Africa is preparing to take the global stage once again. Art Periodic South Africa (A°P), in partnership with the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture (DSAC) and with Latitudes Online as Strategic and Media Partner, is proud to unveil the governance framework for the South African Pavilion at the 61st International Art Exhibition, La Biennale di Venezia (2026). This marks the beginning of a new chapter, one built on collaboration, transparency, and collective authorship. The Pavilion will be delivered through a public–private partnership that balances curatorial independence with public accountability, ensuring a model of shared national stewardship. ------------------------ A Collaborative Approach to Cultural Representation Recognising the importance of continuity in representing South Africa at this landmark international event, DSAC and Art Periodic South Africa (A°P) have formalised a partnership to jointly realise the 2026 Pavilion. Through this collaboration, the Pavilion’s governance and delivery will be strengthened by inclusive sectoral participation, transparent financial management, and broad-based professional expertise. How the Pavilion will be governed The Pavilion is guided by a hybrid leadership model that brings together government, civil society, and the independent arts sector: The Department of Sport, Arts and Culture (DSAC) provides institutional support and funds the Pavilion’s national space in the Arsenale, Venice. The Ambassador of South Africa to Italy serves as Commissioner of the Pavilion, representing the Republic in Venice. Art Periodic South Africa (A°P) acts as administrator and producer, responsible for governance, fundraising, and delivery under independent audit. Latitudes Online serves as Strategic and Media Partner, leading communications, fundraising storytelling, and sectoral engagement. All Pavilion activities are managed within an independently audited framework, ensuring that every decision and contribution is handled with transparency and integrity. Curatorial and Advisory Committees Two core committees are being established to guide the Pavilion’s direction and uphold its values of excellence, inclusivity, and long-term impact. The Curatorial Selection Committee focuses on what will be shown , overseeing the review of proposals and the selection of the curatorial team that will represent South Africa at the Venice Biennale. Its members are curators and arts professionals with proven experience curating major exhibitions locally and internationally, ensuring that the Pavilion achieves the highest standards of artistic and conceptual excellence. The Advisory Committee focuses on how the Pavilion functions , providing strategic insight into funding, sustainability, education, partnerships, and legacy development. Comprising leaders from the arts, business, academic, and philanthropic sectors, the Advisory Committee ensures that the Pavilion operates responsibly and with long-term benefit for South Africa’s cultural landscape. Committee appointments and auditors are being finalised and will be publicly announced once formal documentation and acceptance procedures are complete. Open Call for Curatorial Proposals, Now Live South Africa’s Open Call for Curatorial Proposals for the 2026 Venice Biennale is officially open.Independent curators, collectives, and institutions from across the country are invited to submit exhibition concepts for the South African Pavilion, responding to Koyo Kouoh’s central exhibition, In Minor Keys , a reflection on care, resilience, and the power of under-heard voices. Given the condensed timeline, proposals do not need to be exhaustive. Applicants are encouraged to share clear, compelling curatorial ideas supported by concise conceptual frameworks and indicative budgets. Full technical details can be developed in collaboration with A°P during later phases. This call is about vision, not perfection, inviting curators to propose bold, thoughtful ideas that reflect a distinct South African perspective and contribute to the global conversation Koyo began. Deadline: 24 November 2025 Full guidelines and application materials are available at www.artperiodic.co.za . This is a unique opportunity to shape how South Africa’s creative voices are seen and heard on the world stage, and to help define the nation’s cultural narrative at one of the most influential art exhibitions in the world. Get Involved: Support the South African Pavilion 2026 To realise the Pavilion, Art Periodic South Africa (A°P) is inviting corporates, foundations, and individuals to play an active role in supporting South Africa’s participation at the 2026 Venice Biennale. This shared national effort will help strengthen South Africa’s cultural presence internationally and build a sustainable model for future representation. All partnerships are administered through A°P’s non-profit structure, in alignment with DSAC guidelines, and subject to annual audit and public reporting. Your support directly contributes to the realisation of our national pavilion. Every partnership, large or small, strengthens South Africa’s cultural voice internationally. Together, we can demonstrate how collaboration between government, business, and the creative community can sustain national creativity as a shared civic mission.

A Shared National Effort The South African Pavilion 2026 represents what is possible when government, artists, and civil society work together.

By engaging as a curator, funder, partner, or supporter, every South African can play a role in ensuring that our creative voices continue to resonate on the world’s most important stage.

      <description>The Latitudes Podcast featuring Emma van der Merwe ----------- Powered by: iTOO Artinsure Supported by: BASA Co-curated by: Art School Africa Hosted by: Refiloe Mpakanyane &quot; A good gallerist understands that the artist and their work are the same thing - it’s an extension of their soul, their pain, their DNA. - Emma van der Merwe In this episode of the Latitudes Podcast Refiloe Mpakanyane talks to Everard Read Cape Town Gallery Director, Emma van der Merwe from the dealer’s perspective, talking about the quiet contracts that hold the art world together — trust, instinct, and love for the work itself. In this conversation, she lifts the curtain on the energy and potential driving South Africa’s art scene, reflecting on the delicate balance between representing artists and believing in their long game — with buoyancy at the heart of it all. Emma’s interests in the arts was given the go ahead by her parents with only one condition: that she not walk in their footsteps. And differentiate herself she did! Emma grew up in Switzerland and France, and studied her Bachelors and Masters in Fine Art - at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, before completing a Master’s in Art Management at City University, also in London. &quot; There’s this incredible buoyancy in South Africa — the sense that something extraordinary is always just about to happen. - Emma van der Merwe In this conversation she talks about how Slade gave her access to mentors, teachers and institutions that gave her nothing short of a ‘privileged start’. Even while this same start in the London Arts scene involved no hand holding or indeed involved no blueprint to growth or success. In 2011 Emma joined the SMAC Art Gallery as its curator when its Cape Town doors were opened. Her next notable move was in July 2014 when Emma joined Everard Read Gallery Cape Town, as their Head Curator. In July 2018 she became a Director of the Gallery. Emma talks at length about the energy, potential and allure of South Africa’s art industry which continue to enthral newcomers to our shores. The conversation runs the gamut of nurturing artistic talent; best practice for representing artists; as well as Emma’s insights on forging and maintaining relationships with buyers. Emma also weighs in on collector trends and gives her take on their importance. In sharing what she knows for sure - Emma comes up with a few slogans to live and work by: The vibes have got to be right! Highlights Include: Studying at Slade and being mentored by DamePhyllida Barlow Starting out in the London art scenes and working at blue chip Galleries Getting to work with the likes of Damien Hirst, Sam Taylor Wood and Jenny Saville (among so many others) Deciding to come to South Africa and why the Cape Town ecosystem is compelling The key to artist and collector relationships Referenced exhibitions &amp; institutions: Slade School of Fine Art Goldsmiths St Martins White Cube Gagosian Ruth Proust Everard Read Brett Seiler Chapter 4 (Insights from the Collectors) spans episodes 9-11 of Season 2 of the Latitudes Podcast. It takes a closer look at art collecting as both a cultural and financial practice. Featuring collectors, gallerists, and market experts, this chapter explores the nuances of taste, market influence, and the evolving role of collectors. Listen Now &quot; You can’t rush trust. It’s built in the quiet moments, the small consistencies — that’s the real work. – Emma van der Merwe About the Latitudes Podcast Hosted by dynamic broadcast journalist and penchant for the arts Refiloe Mpakanyane, The Latitudes Podcast, which is the only podcast dedicated to contemporary African art, is an immersive and engaging platform that builds a new layer of access to the contemporary visual arts from Africa.
